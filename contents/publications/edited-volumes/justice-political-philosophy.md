_Justice in Political Philosophy_ focuses in particular on the wide range of positions and debates which have emerged since the publication of John Rawls's _A Theory of Justice_ in 1971. Each view is presented through a representative selection of the major articles by both its proponents and critics. The schools covered include utilitarianism, liberal egalitarianism, libertarianism and their Marxist, communitarian and feminist critics. The authors represented include such influential figures as Rawls, Nozick, Dworkin, Cohen, Gauthier, Harsanyi, Barry, Sandel, MacIntyre, Gilligan and Mackinnon. The editor's introduction explores the interrelations between these diverse theories and shows how there are considerable convergences as well as disagreements in the contemporary debates over justice.
