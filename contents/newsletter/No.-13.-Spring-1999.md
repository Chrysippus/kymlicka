The Ethnobarometer Programme (EP) is a monitoring and reporting system of the state of ethnic relations in Western and Eastern Europe, which started with twelve initial countries in 1998\. The programme's aim is to provide independent and research-based reports on levels of racism, xenophobia, and ethnic conflict in selected countries of Central, Eastern and Western Europe. The programme monitors events, highlights areas of tension, and identifies relevant topics for further research. Its focus encompasses both territorial minorities and communities of recent migrant origin. EP is coordinated by Alessandro Silj (Italian Social Science Council) and Malcolm Cross (Centre for European Migration and Ethnic Studies, CEMES). The scope of ethnic claims range from a quest for entry into the polity (e.g. demands for legal residence rights) to that of exit from it (e.g. demands for secession) by way of equity within it (i.e. cultural pluralism). Entry and exit are the two poles of a continuum. Generally, the demands of ethno-territorial communities move from equity to exit, whereas the demands of immigrant communities move from entry to equity. The Ethnobarometer Programme monitors and evaluates both Eastern and Western Countries that involve both forms of cultural diversity.
