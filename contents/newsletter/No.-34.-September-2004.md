The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year, research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a quarterly newsletter updating recent developments, of which this is the thirty-fourth issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or various non-governmental organizations.

1. Call for Papers

The editors of the journal "Global Review of Ethnopolitics" invite original papers for a special issue on the dynamics underlying electoral politics in ethnically divided societies. Free and fair elections are one of the most fundamental characteristics of democratic systems; in ethnically divided societies, elections and the rules and regulations on which they are based are especially important, because they provide important levers to guarantee (or in certain cases prevent) adequate representation of different ethnocultural groups in state institutions. The aim of this special issue is to provide empirical evidence and analysis of recent elections in ethnically divided societies, on a comparative or single-case basis, that can improve our understanding of these dynamics in concrete contexts. The deadline for submissions is: December 31, 2004\. Please email your contributions as attachments to: Florian Bieber (bieberf@gmx.net) and Stefan Wolff (S.Wolff@bath.ac.uk).

A call for papers has been issued for a forthcoming volume of essays on Hannah Arendt. The volume will be entitled "Imperialism, Slavery, Race and Genocide: The Legacy of Hannah Arendt". It will seek to use Arendt's insights as a source for further investigation into the ways in which race, imperialism, slavery, and genocide are linked, and the ways in which these terms have affected the United States, Europe, and the "colonised world" in different ways. The volume is meant not as another set of essays exploring Arent's thought, but rather as an experiment in intellectual history that uses Arendtian terms and concepts to explain the racialization of the "enlightened" west. Proposals (500-1000 words) should be sent by September 30, 2004, to Richard H. King (email: Richard.king@nottingham.ac.uk) and Dan Stone (email: d.stone@rhul.ac.uk).

1. RECENT INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES

Three recent international and intergovernmental initiatives may be of interest to readers.

(a) HDR 2004: The annual Human Development Report of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has taken as its theme in 2004, 'Cultural Liberty in Today's Diverse World'. The Report argues that accommodating ethnic, religious, linguistic and cultural diversity should be seen as a vital part of human development. This is the first time that the HDR has focused on the link between ethnocultural diversity and development. The Report defends a range of multiculturalism policies as a means towards eradicating poverty and building inclusive societies. The Report can be downloaded from the UNDP website: <http://hdr.undp.org/reports/global/2004/>

Readers may also be interested in the extensive background papers and statistical analyses used to support the Report's conclusions, which focus on a wide range of minority groups and regions of the world. These are posted at: <http://hdr.undp.org/publications/papers.cfm> The link between cultural liberty and human development, will be the focus of the next Global Forum on Human Development in Paris, France, January 17-19,

1. This will be third in a series of such events started by the Human Development Report Office in 1999\. The Forum is sponsored by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France and UNDP in cooperation with Sciences-Po and IDDRI. The Human Development Forums feature the latest thinking, research, and innovation on current issues and help shape the international agenda for human development.

(b) GCIM: The Secretary-General of the UN has established a "Global Commission on International Migration" (GCIM) to help formulate recommendations on the international management of migration. The Commission's mandate includes an extensive range of research and policy analysis, leading to a final report due in mid-2005\. Details on the Commission and its work can be found at: [www.gcim.org](http://www.gcim.org)

(c) Bolzano Declaration: The European Academy, in cooperation with the European Commission and the Open Society Institute, has developed a series of policy recommendations for the protection of minorities in the enlarged European Union. This "Bolzano Declaration" is one aspect of the larger project to establish a "Platform for an enriching culturally and ethnically diverse Europe" (PECEDE), which will include a range of publications and website resources.
