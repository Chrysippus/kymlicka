#### 1\. Introduction

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year, research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a quarterly newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the forty-third issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or non-governmental organizations.

If you would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, please contact us at cded@post.queensu.ca. Back-issues of the newsletter are posted on the Web on Will Kymlicka's home-page: <http://www.queensu.ca/cded/news.html>

#### 2\. POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP IN DEMOCRACY AND DIVERSITY

We are now inviting applications for the third year of the postdoctoral fellowship program in "Democracy and Diversity" at Queen's University, funded in part by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. Each year, one non-renewable 12-month fellowship will be awarded. The fellow will work under the supervision of Prof. Will Kymlicka, and may be invited to teach up to two half-courses. The 2007-8 fellowship will commence on July 1, 2007, with a minimum salary of \$40,000 Cdn. before remuneration for teaching. Applicants must have submitted their doctoral dissertation by that date, and must be within five years of having received their doctorate. The fellowship is part of a larger nexus of activities at Queen's relating to the normative and empirical study of democracy and diversity, including the Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy; the Ethnicity and Democratic Governance project (<http://www.queensu.ca/edg/>) the Fulbright Visiting Professorship in Nationalism, Ethnicity and Multicultural Citizenship; the Centre for the Study of Democracy; and the Institute of Intergovernmental Relations - all of which have active programs of workshops, conferences and visiting scholars and speakers. The Fellow would be expected to participate in these various activities as appropriate, including presentation of his or her research findings, and to assist Prof. Kymlicka in the Forum's activities. While "Democracy and Diversity" is to be understood expansively, and there are no pre-determined limits on the topics it may cover, Queen's has a special expertise in issues of ethnocultural diversity. Recent and ongoing activities have covered such topics as immigration and citizenship, multiculturalism and multicultural education, indigenous rights, affirmative action, historic injustice, nationalism and secession, language rights, and transnational democracy. Applicants who combine normative analysis with empirical case studies are particularly welcome. Applications are due by March 1, 2007, and should include a curriculum vitae, together with a statement of research interests, a teaching dossier, and a writing sample. Applications should be sent to the Department of Philosophy, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada, K7L 3N6\. It is the responsibility of the applicants to have at least three letters of reference sent directly to the above address by the deadline. For further information please contact lavoiemm@post.queensu.ca, or check the Philosophy Department website at: <http://www.queensu.ca/philosophy/>
