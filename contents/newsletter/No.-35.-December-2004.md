#### 1\. Introduction

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a quarterly newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the thirty-fifth issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or various non-governmental organizations.

With this issue, we would like to make two important new announcements. First, we have new email and website addresses. Second, we are sponsoring a new postdoctoral fellowship. Details are below.

#### 2\. NEW CONTACT INFORMATION

As a result of changes to Queen's server, we are changing both our email and website addresses. Our new email address is <cded@post.queensu.ca>. If you would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, or would like to send us material to include in future issues, please contact us at this new address.

The website address for Will Kymlicka's home-page - which contains back-issues of the newsletter, and other internet resources related to democracy and diversity - has also changed. It is now: <http://post.queensu.ca/~kymlicka/>

#### 3\. NEW POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP IN DEMOCRACY AND DIVERSITY

We are happy to announce a new postdoctoral fellowship program in "Democracy and Diversity" at Queen's University, funded in part by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. The program will run from 2005-2008\. Each year, one non-renewable 12-month fellowship will be awarded, working under the supervision of Prof. Will Kymlicka.

The fellowship is part of a larger nexus of activities at Queen's relating to the normative and empirical study of democracy and diversity, including the Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy; the Research Group on Nationalism, Ethnicity and Multicultural Citizenship (www.queensu.ca/politics/rgonemc); the Fulbright Visiting Professorship in Nationalism, Ethnicity and Multicultural Citizenship; the Centre for the Study of Democracy; and the Institute of Intergovernmental Relations - all of which have active programs of workshops, conferences and visiting scholars and speakers. The Fellow would be expected to participate in these various activities as appropriate, including presentation of his or her research findings, and to assist Prof. Kymlicka in the Forum's activities. The Fellow would also be expected to do some teaching (two half-courses). While "Democracy and Diversity" is to be understood expansively, and there are no pre-determined limits on the topics it may cover, Queen's has a special expertise in issues of ethnocultural diversity. Recent and ongoing activities have covered such topics as immigration and citizenship, multiculturalism and multicultural education, indigenous rights, affirmative action, historic injustice, nationalism and secession, language rights, and transnational democracy. Applicants who combine normative analysis with empirical case studies are particularly welcome. For application details, check the Philosophy Department website at: <http://www.queensu.ca/philosophy/>
