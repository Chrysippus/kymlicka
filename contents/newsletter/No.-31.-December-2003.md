#### 1\. Introduction

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year, research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a quarterly newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the thirty-first issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or various non-governmental organizations.

If you would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, please contact us at cded@post.queensu.ca. Back-issues of the newsletter are posted on the Web on Will Kymlicka's home-page:

The Summer Program on Human and Minority Rights organized by Humanity in Action (HiA) will be held in June 2004\. HiA is an international organization that brings together Danish, Dutch, German, and American students with an active interest in human and minority rights. Students from American, Danish, Dutch and German universities are invited to submit applications for the four week June 2004 Program, which will be followed by a one week meeting in the United States in October 2004\. As part of the Summer Program, HiA-Fellows will also have the opportunity to attend advanced lectures and seminars in Copenhagen, Berlin, New York, and Washington D.C. Various historical and contemporary human rights and minority issues will be considered. Papers will be published in the HiA 2005 Report. Costs and expenses for participants will largely be covered by HiA. Deadlines for applications are December 15, 2003 (German program) or Spring 2004 (Dutch and Danish program).
