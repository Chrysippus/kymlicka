#### 1\. Introduction

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year, research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the sixty-fourth issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or non-governmental organizations.

If you would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, please contact us at <cded@queensu.ca>. Back-issues of the newsletter are posted on the Web on Will Kymlicka's home-page: <http://post.queensu.ca/~kymlicka/ddnewsletter.php>

#### 2\. Upcoming Conferences

Speakers include Professor Tariq Modood (Bristol University), Humera Khan (An-Nisa Society), and Dilwar Hussain (Islamic Society of Britain). This workshop will bring together academic contributors from Britain and across Europe to discuss Muslim participation in forms of contemporary governance. The discussion will be followed by a public Report Launch Event in the evening, featuring a research presentation from the AHRC/ESRC project Muslim Participation in Contemporary Governance. For details on the Muslim Participation in Contemporary Governance (MPCG) project, please visit: <http://www.bristol.ac.uk/ethnicity/projects/muslimparticipation/>

The 5th Global Forum of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC): "Promoting Responsible Leadership in Diversity and Dialogue" will be held on February 27 and 28, 2013 in Vienna, Austria. The forum will provide participants with a unique global platform for constructive and result-oriented dialogue to share best practices and to develop joint initiatives and new partnerships. It will bring together political leaders, representatives of international and regional bodies, the private sector, civil society groups, youth, arts, and the media as well as donor agencies and foundations to explore new ways of promoting cross-cultural dialogue and understanding. For more information, see <http://www.vienna5unaoc.at>.

The American Graduate School in Paris is holding its 8th Annual AGS Graduate Student Conference on the theme "Identity and Gender Politics within International Relations", in Paris, France on April 18-19, 2013\. The aim of the conference is to analyze the impact of identity and gender within the social and cultural framework of International Relations. Commonalities and intersections between these areas, as well as their impact on interstate and state governance, international conflict, and public awareness should be a main concern of conference contributors. For more information about the conference, visit <http://www.ags.edu/news/ags-annual-conference/>.

The Social Science Research Center (WZB) in Berlin is organizing a conference on "Ethnic Diversity and Social Capital: Mechanisms, Conditions and Causality" on May 24-25, 2013\. The debate on trust, cooperation, and civic engagement in ethnically diverse communities has proliferated rapidly over the last decade. Dozens of studies have been conducted, covering a variety of countries and levels of analysis, across a range of indicators of social capital, and using divergent operationalizations of diversity. The outcomes of these studies have been almost as varied as their research designs. The time has come to draw up the balance, in order to identify both what we have learned, and what has remained unresolved. In doing so, we want to move beyond the inconclusive discussion of the mere absence or presence of correlations between diversity and social capital. More can be gained by focusing on the causal mechanisms linking the two, and on moderating factors that point towards conditional effects of diversity. In order to achieve this aim, we want to bring together leading scholars who carry out cutting-edge research on the mechanisms and conditions of diversity effects. For this event, we invite about 20 scholars from several disciplines to present new and unpublished studies on the linkages between ethnic diversity and social capital. If you would like to present your ongoing research on the mechanisms and conditions of diversity effects, please submit your proposal before February 17, 2013 at <http://www.wzb.eu/mad/call-for-papers>. The confirmed list of speakers includes: Dietlind Stolle, McGill University and Miles Hewstone, University of Oxford (keynote speakers); Peter Thisted Dinesen, University of Copenhagen; Frank Kalter, University of Mannheim; Karen Schönwälder, Sören Petermann and Jörg Hüttermann, MPIMMG Göttingen; Eric M. Uslaner, University of Maryland; Susanne Veit, WZB. Conference organizers are Ruud Koopmans, Bram Lancee and Merlin Schaeffer (WZB).

The theme of the annual Matchpoints seminar at the University of Aarhus will be "Culture of Politics, Economics and International Relations", to be held on May 23-25, 2013 at Aarhus, Denmark. The theme has been inspired by two sources: Robert Putnam's research in social capital and institutions and Jan-Erik Lane and Uwe Wagschal's recent book Culture and Politics. Invited speakers, in addition to Putnam, Lane and Wagschal, include Pippa Norris, John Hall, Ronald Inglehart, Ole Weaver, John Hutchinson, Will Kymlicka, Ove Pederson, Georg Sorenson, Frederik Stjernfelt, Antje Gimmler, and Ole Waever. The conference will focus on the role of culture in contemporary politics, political science and International Relations and, more broadly, discuss the methods by which the significance of culture for politics and society may be studied. Paper proposals are welcome on the following subjects: (1) social capital, democracy and state cohesion; (2) cultural diversity and the politics of recognition; (3) value-oriented politics; (4) religion and politics; (5) methodology and emerging research avenues and opportunities. Deadline for proposals is February 1, 2013\. For more information, visit <http://matchpoints.au.dk/>.

The Center of Excellence on "Cultural Foundations of Social Integration" at the University of Konstanz is organizing a conference on "Accommodation Policies & Territorial Dynamics in Multilevel States" to take place on June 13-15 2013 in Konstanz, Germany. The aim of this conference is to shed light on fundamental questions about how to accommodate cultural diversity and to compare policies of diversity management in different contexts. For a call for papers with a deadline of January 31st 2013, see <https://www.dvpw.de/uploads/media/Call_for_Papers_01.pdf>.

The Department of Philosophy at Fatih University, Istanbul is hosting a conference on "Pluralism and Conflict: Distributive Justice beyond Rawls and Consensus" on June 6–8 2013\. The convenors are Prof. Dr. Manuel Andreas Knoll (mknoll@fatih.edu.tr), Nurdane Simsek (<nsimsek@fatih.edu.tr>), Department of Philosophy, Fatih University.

A workshop on "Theorizing 'the Local Turn' in Immigrant Policies: A Multi-level Approach" will be held at Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona on 20 September 2013\. They invite workshop contributions to address the normative framework of a theory of local turn, taking into account the different approaches of local governance in various European states. For more information, you can check GRITIM's web for further information: <http://www.upf.edu/gritim/actualitat/callforpapers2013.html>.

The Network for Migration and Culture is organizing a conference entitled "Crossroads: Europe, Migration and Culture" on October 24-25 2013 at the University of Copenhagen. The emphasis is on the aesthetic expressions of the migrant experience as such as well as on the consequences of migration for European cultures and identities at large. While contributions may take their cue from sociological and anthropological research, the focus of the conference is distinctly cultural and aesthetic. Not only because these aspects seem to be somewhat under-investigated, but also because cultural artefacts have the potential to make visible what is otherwise largely hidden, even to thorough sociological analyses – aspects such as emotions, attitudes, hope, resentment, longing, etc. We invite both theoretical contributions and analytical papers addressing singular or comparative case studies of the cultural and aesthetic dimensions of migration to and within Europe For more information, and the call for papers, visit: <http://migrationandculture.ku.dk/call/crossroads/Crossroads.CFP.pdf>.
