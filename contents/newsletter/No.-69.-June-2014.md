The annual MANCEPT conference, organized by the Manchester Center for Political Theory, will include a 3-day workshop on the theme "Multiculturalism and Obligations: Individual, Group, Society, and State", convened by Domenico Melidoro (Center for Ethics and Global Politics, LUISS University, Rome). The literature on multiculturalism has explored the obligation of states towards minorities, but little has been written about the obligations of individuals towards their group, to society generally or to the state. This workshop aims to connect traditional multicultural issues with theories of obligation. The workshop invites submission on the following (and related) topics: obligations and multiculturalism; the obligations of individuals to their groups, society, and state; the nature and limits of these obligations; multiculturalism and anarchism. Professor John Horton (Keele University) will be the keynote speaker of the workshop. If you are interested in participating in this workshop, please submit an abstract (up to 1000 words) to <domenico.melidoro@gmail.com> by June 1st 2014\.

The European Academy Bolzano/Bozen and the Institute for Minority Rights will hold an event on "Pro-independence Movements & Migration: Discourse, Policy and Practice" on October 24, 2014 in Bolzano, Italy. International migration has become an important reality for autonomous territories in the Western world, such as Catalonia, South Tyrol, Scotland, Basque Country, and Quebec. What role does migration play in the politics of pro-independence movements? How do pro-independence movements co-opt, integrate or exclude individuals or groups with migration background in their negotiations with the central state? How do people with migration background undermine or support the aims of pro-independence movements? The conference organizers are Roberta Medda-Windischer (Institute for Minority Rights/European Academy Bolzano/Bozen), Patricia Popelier (University of Antwerp), David Forniès and Ricard Vilaregut (Centre Internacional Escarré per a les Minories Ètniques i les Nacions (CIEMEN), Barcelona).
