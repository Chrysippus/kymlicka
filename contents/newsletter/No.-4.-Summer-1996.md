#### 1\. Introduction

The Canadian Centre for Philosophy and Public Policy (CCPPP) at the University of Ottawa is organizing a multi-year, inter-disciplinary research project on "Citizenship, Identity and Democracy in the Multiethnic State", under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the CCPPP will distribute a quarterly newletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the fourth issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or various non-governmental organizations.

To subscribe to this service send e-mail to Listserv@brownvm.brown.edu ; leave the subject line blank, and make the message say SUBSCRIBE BEARS-L Your Name List members will be sent reviews by e-mail, and so they will know when new reviews have appeared without having to check the Web page. Nothing will be sent out through this list except new reviews and occasional brief announcements or information about BEARS.

- The South African Constitutional Assembly Database Project <http://www.constitution.org.za> The South African election of 27 April 1994 produced not only the government of National Unity, but also the historic Constitutional Assembly (CA), which has the task of producing a new Constitution for South Africa. The new constitution will be drawn up by the 490 elected representatives of the people in the Constitutional Assembly. However, the Constitutional Assembly has resolved to ensure that the constitution-making process is people driven. It has made availabe a complete collection of draft constitutions, interim constitutions, annual reports, party submissions, minutes and reports. The objective of establishing this data base system is to ensure maximum transparency and accessibility by all who have an interest to participate in this process. It contains a complete collection of the CA's minutes and reports. Once there, please read "How to use the Searchable Database" for instructions on how to locate a particular minute or report on the Web server.

- ROADMAP96 <Listserv@lists.internic.net> or <http://www.ua.edu/~crispen/roadmap.html> For those of you who are still learning their way around the Internet, there is an excellent (and free!) workshop which you might find helpful.

The lessons will be sent to your e-mail account over a two-week period. You can examine them as you receive them, or save them and study them when you have more time. The original ROADMAP workshop, which debuted in the fall of 1994, rapidly became the most popular on-line Internet training workshop. ROADMAP96 is a completely revised and updated version of the original ROADMAP workshop. Topics covered include: E-mail; LISTSERVs, Majordomo, Listproc, and other e-mail distribution systems; Usenet; FTP; Archie; Gopher; Veronica; Address Searches; the Web; and many other topics. The new ROADMAP96 workshop starts every two weeks. All you have to do to participate is subscribe to the ROADMAP96 e-mail distribution list.
