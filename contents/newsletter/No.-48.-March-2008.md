The Ethnicity and Democratic Governance (EDG) project is organizing a workshop on the theme "The Secular State and Religious Diversity", to be held in Ottawa, Canada in November 2008\. Religious diversity is a dimension of ethnic diversity that has yet to receive due attention, despite the high cost of failure to accommodate religious diversity. This is partly due to a common assumption that modern societies will become secular, as different cultures converge in a neutral liberal democratic world-system. This workshop will examine whether mechanisms used to manage religious pluralism in contemporary societies are tools to reproduce western secular models of governance, insensitive to local knowledge. Is the secular state an "oppressive form of state"? The workshop will take place at the University of Ottawa in November 2008\. Papers presented at the workshop will be assembled for publication in a collected volume. Those interested in participating should send a short statement outlining the theme of the proposed paper to: André Laliberté (<alaliber@uottawa.ca>) and Rajeev Bhargava (<rbhargav@vsnl.com>). Additional information is available on the EDG website <http://www.edg-gde.ca>

The Association of Canadian Studies will hold its annual conference in Quebec City, from October 24-25th, 2008, on the theme "Canadian Dialogue: The State of Relations between Canada's Communities".

Abstracts of no more than 150 words should be submitted by April 15th, 2008 to James Ondrick (email: <james.ondrick@acs-aec.ca>). For further information, visit the following website: <http://www.h-net.org/announce/show.cgi?ID=159896>.
