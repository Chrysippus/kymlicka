#### 1\. Introduction

The Canadian Centre for Philosophy and Public Policy (CCPPP) at the University of Ottawa is coordinating a multi-year, inter- disciplinary research project on "Citizenship, Identity and Democracy in the Multiethnic State", under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the CCPPP is distributing a quarterly newletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the fifth issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or various non-governmental organizations. If you know anyone who would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, or if you would like copies of the back- issues, please contact us at <cded@post.queensu.ca>. For further information about the research project, or the CCPPP more generally, you can also reach us by phone (613 545-2182) and fax (613 545-6545).

- There are two important changes at the Centre for Ethnic Studies at the Universite de Montreal, which we mentioned in the first issue of our newsletter. First, it recently established the new "Centre d'excellence sur l'immigration, i'integration et la dynamique urbaine", under the direction of Marie McAndrew. This is one of four "Centres of Excellence on Immigration and Integration" across Canada which are being funded by the federal government as part of the "Metropolis Project" - an enormous international research project which will analyze the impact of immigration on the largest cities around the world. Second, the Centre has just published the first issue of its own (French-language) newsletter, entitled "Convergences". The newsletter discusses the various research projects of the Centre, including its work on immigrant languages, pluralism in education, and ethnic relations, as well as listing recent publications in the field. To receive a hard copy of "Convergences" in the mail, contact the Centre d'etudes ethniques, Universite de Montreal, CP 6128, succursale A, Montreal H3C 3J7 Canada.

- Another of the new Centres funded under the Metropolis project is the "Prairie Centre of Excellence for Research on Immigration and Integration" at the University of Alberta, under the direction of Baha Abu-Laban. This Centre is in fact a consortium of five prairie universities - Alberta, Calgary, Manitoba, Regina and Saskatchewan. They too will soon be producing a newsletter discussing their research activities.
