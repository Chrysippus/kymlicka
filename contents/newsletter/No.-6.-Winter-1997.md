#### 1\. Introduction

The Canadian Centre for Philosophy and Public Policy (CCPPP) at the University of Ottawa is organizing a multi-year, inter-disciplinary research project on "Citizenship, Identity and Democracy in the Multiethnic State", under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the CCPPP will distribute a quarterly newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the sixth issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or various non-governmental organizations. If you know anyone who would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, or if you would like copies of the back-issues, please contact us at <cded@post.queensu.ca>. For further information about the research project, or the CCPPP more generally, you can also reach us by phone (613 545-2182) and fax (613 545-6545).

#### 2\. CCPP Conference

The Canadian Centre for Philosophy and Public Policy is pleased to announce that we are organizing a major international conference on "Citizenship in Diverse Societies: Theory and Practice", to be held at the University of Toronto on October 4/5 1997\. There will be sessions on six different problems for citizenship in pluralistic societies: (1) political participation and representation, (2) language rights, (3) citizenship education and religious diversity, (4) immigration and multiculturalism, (5) aboriginal rights, and (6) nationalism and federalism. We are inviting two distinguished academics to address each particular session, and their papers will be followed by a commentary from a specialist working on policy "in the field" (eg, in government or an NGO). We will provide more details in the next issue of our newsletter. For more information, please contact us at <ccppp@aix1.uottawa.ca>, or by fax at 613- 562-5135.

A preliminary program for the conference is available by clicking [here](prelim.html).

#### 5\. Two New Electronic Journals

Two new electronic journals have been established which may be of interest to our readers. The first is called "Theory and Event", published by the Electronic Journals Division of Johns Hopkins University Press. It is an international journal which "welcomes theoretical interventions, interpretations and celebrations of events, institutions, cultures, and issues as they unfold". It features essays and other forms of representation (poetry, photos, montage) which "address the power of sovereignty, territory and government; old, new and emerging forms of identity; and the politics of representation as it appears in elections, protest, commodities and high and popular cultures". Submissions can be e-mailed to the Co-Editors of the journal, Thomas Dumm (<tldumm@amherst.edu>) or Anne Norton (<anorton@sas.upenn.edu>), or hard copies sent to THEORY AND EVENT, Political Science, Amherst College, Amherst MA 01002 USA. The website for the journal is: <http://muse.jhu.journals/tae/>

A second new journal is INJUSTICE STUDIES, a refereed international and interdisciplinary electronic journal that helps focus academic attention on the study of injustices around the world. The editors welcome essays devoted to understanding the nature of injustice, types of injustice, and the history, politics, and moral psychology of particular injustices, ranging from global to local events. For more information, contact Thomas Simon, of the Philosophy Department of Illinois State University, by e-mail at: <twsimon@ilstu.edu>. Or visit the journal's website at: <http://www.philosophy.ilstu.ed/philosophy/injustice/injustice/htm>

#### 6\. Internet Resources

<http://www.ercomer.org/wwwvl/> We mentioned this site in our first newsletter, but are listing it again, partly because we have received many new subscribers in the last year who may not be aware of it, and partly because they have created a new mailing-list for people who wished to be kept informed about updates to the site. This site is a superb "Virtual Library" on migration and ethnic relations, run by the European Research Centre on Migration and Ethnic Relations (ERCOMER) at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands. It is perhaps the most comprehensive site available, and includes detailed lists of research centres, university programs, journals and newsletters, conferences, internet discussion lists and data archives from around the world which specialize in ethnic relations. It should be the first stop for anyone wanting to get a sense of the resources available on the internet. At the end of the library, you can "click" to get included on the VL mailing list, so as to receive updates regarding new entries or corrections to the Virtual Library.

<http://www.bsos.umd.edu/cidcm/mar> This is the website for the Minorities At Risk Project, headed by Dr. Ted Robert Gurr. It is an independent, university-based research project that monitors and analyzes the status and conflicts of 268 politically-active communal groups in the larger countries of the world. It is designed to provide information in standardized form that will contribute to the understanding and peaceful accommodation of conflicts involving communal groups. Material relating to all 268 groups included in the project is available on the Website. Information available includes the group's name and estimated population, a background account of the group's characteristics and political setting, a chronology of events initiated by or affecting the group from 1990 to 1995, and an assessment of prospects for change in the group's status in the near future.

<http://www.uel.ac.uk/faculties/socsci/law/MR/min.html> The University of East London has established the UEL Minority Rights Database. It is a legal database containing international documents on minorities, judicial decisions by international fora on minority rights in different countries, a recommended reading list on the topic of minority rights, and some information on the related topics of self-determination, equality and discrimination under international law, as well as a set of links to other related Web sites. The database is intended to be a resource and guide for students, academics and practitioners.

<http://humanitas.ucsb.edu/aa.html> This is the website for the Affirmative Action and Diversity Project, directed by Carl Gutierrez-Jones at the University of California, Santa-Barbara. It presents diverse opinions on Affirmative Action topics, both pro and con, and is intended as an academic resource for scholars, students and the interested public. It contains on-site articles and analyses, policy documents, current legislative updates, and an annotated bibliography of research and teaching materials.

<http://h-net2.msu.edu/~ethnic/> H-ETHNIC is a daily internet discussion forum focused on scholarly topics in ethnicity, race relations, migration and immigration policy, concentrating largely on North America and Europe It includes news and announcements, and encourages debates on interdisciplinary themes.

#### 7\. Related Research Programs

- The Department of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison is organizing an NEH-sponsored seminar on "Nation, State and Cultural Pluralism", directed by Crawford Young, from 16 June to 8 August 1997\. Participation is limited to faculty at non-Ph.D.-granting institutions and independent scholars. Participants will receive a \$4000 stipend. The syllabus includes history and philosophy, as well as poltiical science, and participants need not be political scientists. The object of the seminar is to enlarge the scholarly competence of participants in this field of knowledge, and to equip them with an analytical framework for understanding the complex dynamics of the politics of cultural pluralism. The seminar will hold three two-hour sessions per week. Each participant will be expected to pursue some individual project within this general framework, whose nature will depend upon the professional needs and preferences of the individual. For more information and application materials, contact <neh@polisci.wisc.edu>.
