#### 6\. Related Research Programs

A Dialogue on Democracy and Pluralism in South Asia, funded by the Ford Foundation, has been recently launched at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India. This project focuses on questions regarding pluralism and democracy in South Asia. How do demands of democracy and imperatives of a plural social order frame each other in the countries of South Asia? How do these societies accommodate diverse ethnic demands, and what are the mechanisms by which they do this? The purpose of the network is to begin a process of rethinking on citizenship, ethnic/cultural identity, communitarian mobilization and democracy, conflict and accommodation, with particular emphasis on South Asia. For further information, contact the project directors Dr. Bishnu Mohapatra and Dr. Niraja Gopal Jayal, Centre for Political Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi 110067, India; e-mail: <Bishnu_mohapatra@hotmail.com> or <jayal@ndb.vsnl.net.in>

The Institute for Intercultural and International Studies (InIIS) is an interdisciplinary research institute that embraces the disciplines of sociology, political science and political philosophy. It is concerned with the study of social and cultural change and questions of integration. InIIS is currently conducting a project on "Ethno-national Conflicts" under the direction of Ulrich Schneckener. The project is concerned with models for the resolution of minority conflicts in Europe. The study examines existing institutional arrangements for the recognition of difference that allows national minorities self-government, and evaluates the historical and contemporary experience of Eastern and Western Europe with these procedures. Four models are examined: (1) protection of minorities within states, (2) bilateral arrangements, (3) concordance democracy, (4) territorial solutions.
