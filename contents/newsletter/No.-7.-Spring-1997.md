#### 1\. Introduction

The Canadian Centre for Philosophy and Public Policy (CCPPP) at the University of Ottawa is organizing a multi-year, inter-disciplinary research project on "Citizenship, Identity and Democracy in the Multiethnic State", under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the CCPPP will distribute a quarterly newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the seventh issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or various non-governmental organizations.

If you know anyone who would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, or if you would like copies of the back-issues, please contact us at <cded@post.queensu.ca>. For further information about the research project, or the CCPPP more generally, you can also reach us by phone (613 545-2182) and fax (613 545-6545).

#### 2\. Update on CCPPP Conference

In the last issue of the newsletter, we announced that the Canadian Centre for Philosophy and Public Policy is sponsoring a two-day, international conference to be held in Toronto on October 4-5 1997, on "Citizenship in Diverse Societies: Theory and Practice". The list of confirmed speakers includes Jane Mansbridge and Melissa Williams on political participation and representation; Denise Reaume and Pierre Coulombe on language rights; Jeff Spinner-Halev and Eamonn Callan on citizenship education and religious diversity; Jeremy Waldron and Tariq Modood on immigration and multiculturalism; Jacob Levy and Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond on the rights of indigenous peoples; and Phil Resnick and Graham Smith on federalism and nationalism. In each session, the main papers will be followed by a commentary from a specialist working on policy "in the field" (eg, in government or an NGO). The conference will be held at: Bennett Lecture Hall, Flavelle House, Faculty of Law, University of Toronto, 78 Queen's Park, Toronto, Ontario M5S 2C5.

The registration fee is $30 (which includes lunch on Saturday and Sunday), or $10 (without lunch). Since the lunch break will be relatively brief, we encourage people to register for the catered lunch. To register, or for more information, contact Will Kymlicka, Canadian Centre for Philosophy and Public Policy, Department of Philosophy, University of Ottawa, Box 450, Station A, Ottawa K1N 6N5 Canada.

- The Council of Europe is organizing a conference on "Democracy, Human Rights, Minorities: Educational and Cultural Aspects", in Strasbourg France on May 21-23, 1997\. This is the concluding conference of a multidisciplinary project analyzing the educational and cultural aspects of the management of diversity, with special reference to minorities in Europe. The objectives of the Conference include the adoption of a draft Declaration concerning "intercultural democracy". For information, and requests to attend, contact Ms. Rosemary Stauch, School and Out-of-School Education, Council of Europe, F-67075 Strasbourg Cedex, France. Fax: 33-3-88412788; E-mail: <rosemary.stauch@decs.coe.fr>.
- The International Sociological Association's Research Committee on Ethnic, Race, and Minority Relations is organizing a conference on "Multicultural citizenship in the new South Africa" in Cape Town on December 15-17 1997\. The concept of multicultural citizenship is being proposed as a rubric under which to discuss the complexities, challenges, and prospects facing a multi-ethnic, democratic South Africa. As part of its effort to consolidate the new nation, the South African state must act simultaneously as manager and arbiter of difference, but is this a role that can be sustained indefinitely? This conference is an attempt to address the myriad questions which have arisen around the relationship between the individual and the state and collectivities and the state in the new South Africa. Issues of interest include, but are not limited to language policy; education; affirmative action; migrants, refugees, and rights; the arts and state funding; secessionist movements and diversity; national cultural councils; curriculum development; multiculturalism and nationalism. Papers that address these questions in an international and comparative context are especially encouraged. One page (200-300 words) abstracts should be submitted by June 30, 1997 for consideration by the programme committee. Abstracts can be sent to the attention of Ms. Gitanjali Maharaj, PO Box 1739 Cape Town 8000 SOUTH AFRICA; fax: 27-21-461-2589; e-mail: <maharaj@iafrica.com>.

#### 4\. Recent Publications

It would be impossible to list even a fraction of the publications which are relevant to issues of citizenship, democracy and ethnocultural diversity. To keep our listing manageable, we have decided to limit these listings to books and special issues of journals which have symposia on relevant topics (not individual journal articles). Also, in line with the aims of our overall research project, our focus is on those publications which have a strongly theoretical and normative focus, rather than a purely descriptive or comparative focus. Prices, where listed, are in U.S. dollars. To order any of these publications, or to get more information about them, see "Amazon.com" in the Internet Resources section below.

#### 5\. New Journals

A new journal has been established which may be of interest to our readers, called National Identities: History, Geography, Image. It is the first "concentrating on historical and geographical approaches to national identities, their interpretation and expression, and their economic, social, and political impact". Key themes of the journal will be "how and why national identities emerged, their expression, and their transmission", including historical and regional studies of the role of cultural (language, gender, religion, the media, sport, encounters with `the other', etc.) and political (state forms, wars, boundaries) factors in the forging of national identities. If you are interested in contributing to the journal, contact the editors: Peter Catterall, ICBH, Room 357, Senate House, Malet Street, London WCIE 7HU, England. E-mail: <P.P.Catterall@amq.ac.uk>; or Christopher Vernon, School of Planning, Queensland University of Technology, GPO Box 2434, Brisbane, Queensland 4001, Australia. Fax: 61-7-38644308; e-mail: <c.vernon@qut.edu.au>.

#### 6\. Internet Resources

- the Communitarian Network (whose work we mentioned in newsletter #3) has established an electronic mailing list called COMNET (Communitarian Network Update). Subscribers receive a newsletter, about once a month, with details regarding upcoming communitarian events, announcements and other information. To subscribe, send a message saying SUBSCRIBE COMNET to: LISTSERV@hermes.circ.gwu.edu. For more information, contact the list moderator at: <comnet@gwis2.circ.gwu.edu>, or check the Network's web-site at <http://www.gwu.edu/~ccps>
- MINELRES-L (Electronic Resources on Minorities) is a new discussion list devoted to minority issues in Central and Eastern Europe. The list is moderated by Boris Tsilevich, of the Center for Educational and Social Research in Riga, Latvia, with the support of several academic research groups in Germany, Slovakia, Canada, Latvia and Russia. It is funded by the Soros Foundation. Its aims are to provide a forum for discussion of minority and human rights issues in Central and Eastern Europe; to archive and make available information concerning the relevant treaties, laws, NGOS, statistics and publications in the area; and to facilitate human rights NGOs in their use of the internet. To subscribe, send a message to LISTSERV@RIGA.LV saying: SUBSCRIBE MINELRES-L Firstname Lastname For more information, contact the list moderator (MINELRES@MAILBOX.RIGA.LV)
- In newsletter #3 we mentioned the major conference on "Culture and Citizenship" held at the Australian Key Centre for Cultural and Media Policy in Brisbane in October 1996\. Some sixty conference papers have now been posted on the Centre's web-site, covering topics such as "public culture and citizenship" (eg. civic education, arts policy), "peoples and citizenship" (eg., multiculturalism, indigenous peoples, national identity), and "redefining citizenship" (eg., feminism and citizenship, republicanism, transnational citizenship). The papers are posted at: <http://www.gu.edu.au/gwis/hum/conf/culture_citizenship_conf.html>.
  - For information about the Key Centre's regular publications and upcoming conferences, contact the Manager of the Center: Ms. Karen Perkins, Australian Key Centre for Cultural and Media Policy, Faculty of Humanities, Griffith University, Queensland 4111, Australia. Fax: 61-7-38755511; e-mail: K.Perkins@hum.gu.edu.au. Or check the Centre's web-site ( <http://www.gu.edu.au/gwis/akccmp/home.html>)
- There are several ways to check out new book publications on the internet. For example, many university libraries have put their catalogues on the web, as have most university presses. But there is now an even better way to find information on new (or old) books - namely, "Amazon.com", the Internet bookstore. Over 2.5 million books are listed, from both major and minor publishers, all of which can be ordered by credit-card. Like university library catalogues, the list can be searched by author, title, subject or keyword, but Amazon.com provides much more - eg., not just information about the price and availability of each book, but also typically a table of contents and a paragraph-long description of the book, and in some cases quotes from reviews, and even comments from the author! (In fact, authors are encouraged to submit comments for their books). It's worth checking out: <http://amazom.com/>
