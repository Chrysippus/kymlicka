#### 1\. Introduction

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year, research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the sixty-first issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or non-governmental organizations

If you would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, please contact us at <cded@queensu.ca>. Back-issues of the newsletter are posted on the Web on Will Kymlicka's home-page: <http://www.queensu.ca/cded/news.html>

A conference on "Living together in diversity: National societies in the multicultural age" is being hosted at the Central European University, Budapest, 21-22 May 2012\. It aims to explore how living together in diversity is imagined, narrated, organized, justified, and practiced within contemporary national societies. By stressing "in" rather than "with" diversity the organizers want to move away from reifying the dominant "majority" society perspective, which assumes diversity as something "carried" solely by immigrants and something that the "native" society has to cope with. Regionally, the conference will focus on Europe, but contributions discussing other geographical contexts are also welcomed. For more information, contanct Tatiana Matejskova (<MatejskovaT@ceu.hu>), or visit: <http://livingindiversity.eu/>.

The organizers invite workshop contributions that address the normative framework of a theory of diverse representation, taking into account the different approaches to citizenship, political inclusion and representation in various European states.

The Max-Planck-Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity will be hosting a workshop on "Super-diversity: Comparative Questions" to take place on 27-28 September 2012 in Gottingen, Germany. Questions to be posed at the workshop include: What are the links between changing migration patterns and changing patterns of super-diversity? Are there other aspects of social and spatial differentiation that ought to be part of how we understand migration-driven urban diversity? What are the consequences of applying a super-diversity lens to the challenges of social and economic integration of migrants in cities? How can super-diversity variables such as new migration flows, legal statuses and labour market trajectories be better conceptualised for social science research? What are the most suitable approaches to, and methods for, studying super-diversity? Abstracts of no more than 300 words addressing these or similar questions should be sent to Fran Meissner(<meissner@mmg.mpg.de>) by the 30th March 2012 along with a short (max. 1 page) academic CV.

The working languages of the conference will be French, English and Thai. Proposals for papers and inquiries should be sent to Dr Fernand de Varennes, the Conference Convenor, at <fdevarennes@gmail.com>. Proposals should be copied to the International Academy on Language and Law at <academy.inter@sympatico.ca> by 1 March 2012\.

A conference on "Cultural Sustainability, Social Cohesion and Glocal Education" will take place at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in June 2013\. The conference will focus on questions and issues involving cultural diversity and cultural sustainability from multiple disciplinary theoretical (psychology, sociology, education, economics, history, literature) and methodological perspectives. More specifically the conference wishes to critically examine the repertoire of educational strategies and pedagogies available to approach these issues and their implications for their multiple potential beneficiaries (states, communities, parents, students, and teachers). The conference will bring together scholars who have dealt with these issues in the context of studies of minority, migrant, diaspora, and indigenous education throughout the world. In doing so, it will offer a unique opportunity to enrich the knowledge, communication, and cross-pollination of ideas of those who have, because of academic constraints, sustained parallel yet segregated scholarly inquiries. Interested parties should submit an abstract of 600-800 words (not including bibliography) that describes in detail the subject chosen, research aims, a review of relevant literature, methodology adopted and findings. Abstracts should be sent to Zvi Bekerman <mszviman@mscc.huji.ac.il> before March 1, 2012.

The research team will investigate the transnational mobilization of conflict-generated diasporas in Europe and their impact on polities experiencing contested sovereignty in the Balkans, the Caucasus, and the Middle East. The team aspires to answer an overarching question: does the mobilization of conflict-generated diasporas in liberal states have a mitigating or exacerbating effect on political conflict in the original homelands?
