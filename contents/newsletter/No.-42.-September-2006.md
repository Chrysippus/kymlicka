#### 1\. Introduction

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year, research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a quarterly newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the forty-second issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or non-governmental organizations.

If you would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, please contact us at cded@post.queensu.ca. Back-issues of the newsletter are posted on the Web on Will Kymlicka's home-page: <http://www.queensu.ca/cded/news.html>

#### 2\. ETHNICITY AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE PROJECT

Queen's University, in cooperation with the University of Toronto and the University of Quebec in Montreal, was recently awarded a 5-year, \$2.5 million grant to study "Ethnicity and Democratic Governance", under the overall direction of Prof. Bruce Berman. The research is organized along four main themes: (1) what are the causes of ethnic identification and mobilization?; (2) what policies and institutional strategies are available for accommodating ethnic diversity?; (3) what is the role of the international community in facilitating constructive state-minority relations?; and (4) what normative principles should inform our evaluation of the different options for the democratic governance of diversity? The project involves over 30 scholars from several countries and disciplines, as well as partners from both government and civil society. The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy is pleased to be associated with this project, and Will Kymlicka will be coordinating the research done under the third theme on the role of the international community. For more information about this project, please visit the EDG website at: <http://www.edg-gde.ca>. We would particularly encourage students working in this field to join our Student Research Network, which is open to students from any post-secondary institution around the world, and includes various bibliographical and teaching resources, as well as opportunities to share research questions and interests.
