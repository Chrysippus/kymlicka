#### 1\. INTRODUCTION

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year, research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a quarterly newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the fiftieth issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or non-governmental organizations.

An event entitled "Aboriginal Government: Giving Effect to our Constitutional Commitments" is being organized by Sakej Henderson and John Whyte, on November 7-8, 2008 at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.

#### 7\. RELATED PROJECTS

The Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity was established in November 2007 to enhance multi-disciplinary study of diversity in historical and contemporary societies, particularly concerning ethnic and religious forms and dynamics. The Institute's Managing Director is Professor Dr. Steven Vertovec. Projects will investigate multiple forms of diversity, and how they have been shaped and defined, how different processes of inter-ethnic or inter-religious encounters unfold, how patterns and images of diversity evolve, and how relations between concepts of ethnicity and religion develop. As the Institute grows, studies will not solely address migration-related contexts (in so-called migrant-sending, -transit and -receiving societies) but also contexts long characterized by different kinds of diversity, such as in South Africa, the Balkans, India and Brazil. News, events and jobs related to the Institute are found on the following website, which is a section of the Max Planck Society's webpage: <http://www.mmg.mpg.de/english/contemporaryIssues/e_news/index.html>

A new conference section on "Race, Ethnicity, Indigenous Peoples and Politics" will take place at the 2009 annual conference of the Canadian Political Science Association (CPSA). Canadian and International political scientists are increasingly interested in research relating to issues of race, racialization, the role of ethnic, linguistic and religious groups in politics, and the implications of immigration and diversity. Enquiries and suggestions should be sent to: Joseph Wong, Canada Research Chair and Director, Asian Institute, University of Toronto (joewong@chass.utoronto.ca) or Abigail Bakan, Department of Political Studies, Queen's University (bakana@queensu.ca).

The Office of the High Commissioner on National Minorities of the OSCE has recently released the "Bolzano/Bozen Recommendations on National Minorities in Inter-State Relations", the most recent in its set of influential Recommendations on the rights of national minorities. The Bolzano/Bozen Recommendations provide representatives of States, national minorities and international organizations with advice on how to address questions concerning national minorities that arise in the context of inter-State relations in a way that protects and promotes the rights of persons belonging to national minorities, prevents conflict, maintains inter-ethnic harmony and strengthens good neighbourly relations.
