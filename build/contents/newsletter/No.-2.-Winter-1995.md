#### 1\. Introduction

The Canadian Centre for Philosophy and Public Policy (CCPPP) at the University of Ottawa is organizing a multi-year, inter-disciplinary research project on "Citizenship, Identity and Democracy in the Multiethnic State", under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the CCPPP will distribute a quarterly newletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the second issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or various non-governmental organizations. If you know anyone who would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, please contact us at <cded@post.queensu.ca>.

For further information about the research project, or the CCPPP more generally, you can also reach us by phone (613 545-2182) and fax (613 545-6545).

As part of its year-long program on citizenship, the Forum is hosting a number of conferences, including "Social and Political Citizenship in a World of Migration" (February 23-24, 1996); "Multiculturalism, Minorities, and Citizenship" (April 19-20, 1996), and "European Citizenship: An Institutional Challenge" (June 14-15, 1996).

As part of a three-year project on "Political Models of Multiculturalism", the Institute de Filosofia of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas in Madrid is holding a Spanish-Canadian conference on "Citizenship and Nationality: Two References for Political Loyalty", in Madrid on May 21-22

The conference is funded by the Instituto and by the Canadian Embassy in Spain. (There is widespread interest within Spain in Canada's experience with ethnocultural relations, not only because of the parallels between Quebec and Catalonia, but also because Spain has shifted in recent years from being a country of emigration to a country of immigration). For information, contact Prof. Francisco Colom, Instituto de Filosofia, CSIC, Calle Pinar 25, 28006 Madrid (e-mail: <Francisco.Colom@Pinar1.csic.es>).

#### 5\. Internet Resources

In our inaugural issue, we mentioned the very useful information available by internet from both the Centre for Immigration and Migration Studies (CIMS) at the Australian National University in Australia, and the European Research Centre on Migration and Ethnic Relations (ERCOMER) at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands. Both of these Centres have in fact expanded their websites, and made the information more accessible, so we thought we would update you on their internet addresses.

The ERCOMER has established a truly wonderful WWW "Virtual Library" on migration and ethnic relations. It includes detailed lists of research centres, university programs, journals and newsletters, conferences, internet discussion lists and data archives from around the world which specialize in ethnic relations. It should be the first stop for anyone wanting to get a sense of the resources available on the internet. The address is: <http://www.ercomer.org/wwwvl/>

The CIMS has also expanded its listings of international internet resources. To reach the CIMS Home Page, the address is: <http://coombs.anu.edu.au/SpecialProj/CIMS/CIMSHomePage.html> The CIMS occassional newsletter, "POLYPHONY", is now available on the internet. To see the most recent issue, go to <http://coombs.anu.edu.au/SpecialProj/CIMS/Polyphony/Polyphony.html>

The Princeton Population Index contains abstracts of academic articles relating to issues of population. Of particular interest is the section on "Migration", which summarizes a wide range of articles relating to immigration throughout the world. A new issue of the index is posted at this address on a quarterly basis: <http://opr.princeton.edu/popindex/pionline.htm>

An energetic scholar at the University of California Davis has created a new WWW site which reproduces a wide range of newspaper, magazine and journal articles on issues relating to minorities in the United States, particularly immigration, affirmative action, bilingual eduation, and race relations. The articles are usefully categorized by topic, and a short abstract of each is provided, as well as the text in its entirety, which can be downloaded. This site gives one a nice sense of the various levels of public debate in the U.S., from op-ed pieces in major daily papers to more scholarly discussions in journals like Public Interest or Current. The address for this "Minority Affairs Forum" is <ftp://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/pub/README.html> [NB: case sensitive]

As part of its more general "Web Page for Humanities Research", the University of California, Santa Barbara has established a useful "Minority Studies Page". It includes information about publications and research programs relating to minority studies in the United States, subdivided by various groups (African-American; Asian-American; Latino; Immigrant; Jewish; Native-American). <http://humanitas.ucsb.edu/shuttle/minority.html>

Prof. C. McKie at Carleton University has developed a useful list of the "research engines" for people working in the social sciences in Canada. It includes a list of the general internet search engines (eg. Lycos; Uncover), as well as lists of social science and government data archives, journalism sources, StatsCan reports, etc. To reach it: <http://www.carleton.ca/~cmckie/research.html>

If your library is cutting back on its journal subscriptions, or if you can't find the time to browse through the new issues, you might be interested in a service provided by CARL (Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries). The service is called "UnCover", which is an online table of contents index and article delivery service for approximately 17,000 magazines and journals, including virtually all major English-language periodicals in politics, philosophy and law. Almost every article cited in UnCover can be ordered online and delivered to your fax machine within an average of 24 hours, and sometimes within the hour. Searching the database is free (searches by name, title or journal). Articles you order cost approximately $12\. Another interesting service, UnCover Reveal, will deliver the table of contents for up to 50 journals of your choice as soon as an issue is entered in the database. It also allows you to store up to 25 keywords or names which you would like to have searched. It will store these 25 "search strategies" and run them against new article authors and topics, in addition to periodical titles, the results of which will be sent to your email box on a weekly basis. UnCover Reveal costs $20 US annually. A WWW site is available at <http://carl.org/carlweb/> For more information, including how to pay off-line, email <reveal@carl.org> (You should always pay off-line - never give your credit card number over the internet!). To search the database for free, telnet 192.54.81.76, enter your terminal type (usually VT100), then choose "UnCover" (option 1). Keep pressing Return (4 times) and you will be in the search menu. To exit at any time, type //EXIT. If you plan on using the services that cost money, you will have to set up a "profile". Just follow the directions indicated after you have chosen the UnCover option.
