#### 1\. Introduction

The Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities (CRASSH), University of Cambridge is organizing a conference on "Language Endangerment: Language Policy and Planning" at Cambridge on July 26 2013\. Linguistic legislation serves as a medium through which power is negotiated between different speech communities within a given society. Language policy issues are imbued with a powerful symbolism that is often linked to questions of identity, with the suppression or failure to recognize and support a given endangered variety representing a refusal to grant a 'voice' to the corresponding ethnocultural community. This conference will consider how and whether the interface between people, politics and language can affect the fortunes of the endangered linguistic varieties involved. Can policy really alter linguistic behaviour, or does it merely ratify changes already underway within the speech community? Do governments have a moral obligation to support endangered languages? Should linguists play a role in shaping language policy and, if so, what should that role be? When policy decisions are at odds with the will of the speech community, which will triumph?

The Centre for the Study of Mind in Nature, University of Oslo, in partnership with the Instituto de Bioética at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogotà (Colombia), is hosting a conference on "Who Owns It? Land Claims in Latin America: Their Moral Legitimacy and Implications" on August 28-30 2013 in Bogata. The primary objectives are to investigate and evaluate the moral legitimacy of land claims by indigenous and non-indigenous communities in Latin America, and to explore the means that these groups can adopt to vindicate those of their claims that are legitimate. For more information about the conference, and the larger project it is part of, see <http://puj-portal.javeriana.edu.co/portal/page/portal/Bioetica/plt_bio_noticias/Otros%20eventos> and <http://www.hf.uio.no/csmn/english/research/projects/who-owns-it/index.html>

The Arctic Centre at the University of Lapland, in cooperation with the University of Montreal and the University of the Arctic Thematic Network on Arctic Law, is hosting a conference on "Protecting The Sacred: Recognition Of Sacred Sites Of Indigenous Peoples for Sustaining Nature and Culture in Northern and Arctic Regions", on September 11-13\. 2013, to be held at the University of Lapland in Rovaniemi e Pyhä, Finland. The conference brings together scientists, sacred natural sites custodians, Indigenous Peoples' Organizations, policy makers, conservation and civil society leaders, to evaluate options for international and national law, policy and practice in order to better recognize, safeguard, conserve and manage Sacred Natural Sites (SNS) of Indigenous Peoples in Northern and Arctic regions.

The Plurilingualism Research Unit at the University of Graz is hosting the 14th International Conference on Minority Languages to be held on 11-14 September 2013, in Graz, Austria on the theme "Dominated Languages in the 21st Century". Although linguistic plurality and its socio-political stratification is subject to constant change due to global migration, the general perception of minorities - at least in Europe - is still based on romantic folkloristic notions of the 19th century as rural, conservative, immobile relics of another (archaic) culture with another language. This definition, which implicitly also reflects the European nation state ideology, negates all socio-political and socio-cultural developments of the last decades. At least some aspects of this definition still dominate the public discourse on minorities and minority languages. This discourse of otherness in contrast to the established and postulated normality of the majority always insinuates a sense of inferiority of minority groups and languages. The conference aims to challenge this definition in light of contemporary research and in light of ideals of the pluralistic society. See <http://icml14.uni-graz.at>

The Seventeenth Conference of the Foundation for Endangered Languages in association with Carleton University's School of Canadian Studies and School of Linguistics and Language Studies will host a conference on "Endangered Languages Beyond Boundaries: Community Connections, Collaborative Approaches, and Cross-Disciplinary Research" to be held at Carleton University in Ottawa (Canada) on 1-4 October 2013\. The many endangered Indigenous languages across Canada make it an excellent setting for a conference that will explore collaboration, community involvement, and cross-disciplinary research on endangered languages. The conference will highlight community connections, collaborative approaches, intergenerational cooperation, technological and social media related innovations, and community-researcher alliances. It will bring together speakers, activists, and researchers, from a range of disciplines, organizations, and governments, all striving to understand and improve the situation of endangered languages, and to broaden awareness of the importance and implications of language maintenance and revitalization for individual and community well-being overall.

The Interdisciplinary Centre for Social and Language Documentation (CIDLeS) will be hosting at International Conference on Endangered Languages in Europe to be held on 17-18 October 2013 in Minde, Portugal. The 2-day International Conference aims to provide an interdisciplinary forum in which scholars from Language Documentation, Language Technology and others working on European endangered languages can exchange ideas and techniques on language documentation, archiving, and revitalization; as well as reflect on research into linguistic diversity in Europe and language policy issues.

The Faculty of Social Work and Department of Sociology at the University of Manitoba will be hosting its 6th Annual Conference on the Social Reconstructing of "Home" Among Immigrants in the Diaspora to be held October 17-18 in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The main theme of this year's conference is "Pathways and Roadblocks to Settlement and Citizenship in New Homelands: Exploring Critical issues on Migration, Integration and Adaptation of New Comers in Host Societies" The Conference welcomes proposals from researchers, graduate students, NGOs, government representatives, policy makers and other stakeholders from around the world to promote exchange and discussion on aspects of the integration and settlement processes of new immigrants and refugees in the diaspora. The focus will be on the emotional and social deconstruction and reconstruction of the concept of "Home" among these immigrants. The conference will feature keynote and plenary speeches from policy makers, workshops and presen-tations from researchers, front-line settlement and integration workers in the field. See: <http://www.strangersconference.com/>

The Association for Canadian studies and the Canadian Ethnic Studies Association invite proposals for the joint annual conference on the theme "Transforming Citizenship: Ethnicity, Transnationalism, and Belonging in Canada Conference" to be held October 24-26, 2013 in Edmonton, Alberta. See <http://www.acs-aec.ca/en/events/other-events/transforming-citizenship-ethnicity-transnationalism-belonging-in-canada/>

The Austrian Research Association will be hosting a research conference on "Immigration, Incorporation, and Democracy" in Vienna from November 14-15 2013\. The conference is interdisciplinary in orientation and welcomes work from all social sciences and the field of legal studies. Conference topics include: Democratic Deficits, Institutional Change & Innovation, Citizenship, Fundamental Rights, Immigrants' Representation & Participation, Democratic Innovations, Immigrants' Advocacy; Perception/Categorization/Mobility/Diversity; Immigration and Resources. For questions and further information, please contact: Reinhard Heinisch <reinhard.c.heinisch@sbg.ac.at> or Birgit Bahtic-Kunrath <birgit.kunrath@sbg.ac.at> For more on the conference, visit: <http://www.oefg.at/text/veranstaltungen/research_conf_democracy13.html>

The Council of Europe will be hosting its World Forum for Democracy 2013 on the theme "Re-wiring Democracy: connecting institutions and citizens in the digital age", to be held in Strasbourg on 27-29 November 2013\. A decline in democratic participation is often viewed as a symptom of a detachment between citizens and institutions. Social media and social networks enable individuals to exchange, plan, act and interact with politicians and activists outside institutional systems. The Council of Europe is in a unique position to bring together elected politicians and civil society leaders to discuss the impact of this technological change on established democratic structures and institutions. The Forum will look into the opportunities and risks of a number of participatory initiatives and test their solidity and longevity in an open debate with elected politicians. Discussions will take place in labs which will focus on achievement, issues and concerns around specific e-democracy phenomena as a starting point, leading to exchanges on broader issues. The conclusions of the Forum should help to better identify the challenges faced by democratic institutions, political parties and leaders, and to recommend action that might need to be taken at various levels to enhance the benefits of digital participation platforms and limit the risks their use may entail.

The Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity in Göttingen, the Göttingen Diversity Research Institute at Göttingen University, and Kassel University are organizing a workshop on "When, why and how organisations respond to diversity", to be held in Göttingen, Germany, on 6-7 February 2014\. The deadline for paper proposals is 21 October 2013\. The workshop will consider various dimensions of "diversity", including ethnicity, gender, class, disability, and sexual orientation, and how these are addressed in both public and private organisations. We are particularly interested in work on city administrations, welfare state institutions (e.g. in health, higher education) and political organisations (parties, NGOs). We do not restrict the scope of the discussion to particular countries. See the call for papers (pdf) at: <http://www.mmg.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Cfp/cfp_org_and_div.pdf>. Or contact Karen Schönwälder at the Max-Planck-Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity (e-mail: <schoenwaelder@mmg.mpg.de>).

A conference on "Religious 'Others,' Schooling, and the Negotiation of Civic Identities" will take place June 25-28 2014 in Hannover, Germany. It will explore the relationship between hegemonic discourses of citizenship, religio-cultural belonging, and the negotiation of civic identities among religio-cultural minority youths in educational settings. These topics will be explored empirically in presentations and discussion workshops focused on 1) the macro-level of hegemonic formations of citizenship and belonging that characterizes classrooms across a variety of settings, with particular attention to the role of the religious 'other' in these formations, 2) the micro-level of everyday practices through which these formations are enacted in curricula and in the classroom, 3) the personal experience of moments of inclusion, exclusion, and silencing, and 4) the policy level of ongoing transformations and mutual openings that allow for the construction of a shared civic identity among youths as future citizens. For any questions contact Dr. Julia Eksner, Free University of Berlin, at julia.eksner@fu-berlin.de.

#### 3\. New Journals and Book Series

The Center for the Study of Citizenship at Wayne State University has established a new book series in Citizenship Studies. The Series in Citizenship Studies will encourage scholars to work across disciplinary boundaries in order to consider questions of identity, group membership, status, rights, and obligations from a variety of perspectives - artistic, cultural, economic, historical, legal, linguistic, literary, philosophical, political, and social. Titles selected for inclusion in the series will advance the interdisciplinary field of citizenship studies in a significant and identifiable way. Although the volumes published might be primarily empirical or normative, each will address theoretical issues and advance broader understandings of citizenship. For more information, visit: <http://clasweb.clas.wayne.edu/citizenship/BookSeries>. Book proposals should be sent to the general editor, Marc W. Kruman (<m.kruman@wayne.edu>).

The Centre for Governance and Citizenship (CGC) at the Hong Kong Institute of Education will collaborate with Springer on a new book series on Governance and Citizenship in Asia. Governance, with its focus on state and state-society interfaces, remains a fundamental issue in Asia but it is not an issue that that can be treated in isolation. Citizenship issues must also be addressed as civil society assumes a more fundamental role internationally in shaping how governments respond to public policy issues. This Series will address both governance and citizenship issues in such a way that citizenship is seen as an integral part of 'good governance' and governance as ultimately enriching citizenship. It is the interdependence and mutuality of governance and citizenship that is our key concern. The Series Editors are Professor Kerry J Kennedy (Director, CGC), Professor Sonny Lo (Co-Director, CGC) and Dr Leung Yan Wing (Co-Director, CGC). Colleagues and academic peers are welcome to submit book proposal to cgc@ied.edu.hk. The flyer for Call for Book Proposals can be downloaded at <http://www.ied.edu.hk/cgc/> NISE (National movements & Intermediary Structures in Europe) has just published the first issue of Studies on National Movements, its new online journal for comparative nationalism research. This international online journal is devoted to the comparative historiography of national and regional movements and the theory formation of nationalism. In line with NISE's geographical scope, the whole of Europe is included. Visit <http://snm.nise.eu/index.php/studies>

#### 4\. Fellowships and Awards, Courses, Summer Schools

During the academic year 2014-15, the theme for the Fung Global Fellows Program will be "Global Diffusion." The program seeks applications from scholars developing new, innovative ways to study global diffusion processes. The objects of diffusion could be specific modes of social categorization (such as "race" in census forms), principles of legitimation (such as democracy), government policies (such as minority quota systems), forms of conflict (such as revolutions), or cultural practices (such as Tango dancing or marrying "in white"). We especially encourage analytically oriented approaches that identify recurring patterns and mechanisms through rigorous comparison of multiple cases or quantitative analysis, with broad geographic (preferably transcontinental) coverage. Researchers working on all historical periods of the modern age, all regions of the world and of all disciplinary backgrounds in the social sciences and humanities are encouraged to apply. For questions please contact the program's assistant director, Beate Witzler (bwitzler@exchange.Princeton.edu). More information can be found on the program's website at <http://www.princeton.edu/funggfp/index.xml>

The Center for the Study of Citizenship at Wayne State University has established a Book Award in the Study of Citizenship, given biennially to a book that illuminates the study of citizenship in a fresh, thought provoking, and engaging manner. The book award recognizes books published during the previous two calendar years. Nominations for the award are made by advisors to the Center for the Study of Citizenship at Wayne State University, authors, and publishers. Selection of the winning book is made by a three-person selection committee, which changes biennially. The 2015 award will be presented at the 12th annual Conference in Citizenship Studies at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan in the spring of 2015\. The winner will be invited to speak at the 2015 conference and travel expenses will be provided. Books published between October 2012 and September 2014 are eligible for consideration and nominations may be made by publishers or individuals.

#### 5\. Internet Resources

The University of Bristol's Centre for Ethnicity, with funding from the Arts and Humanities Research Council, has established a new on-line forum on faith and public policy, called "Public Spirit". The forum aims to prompt "spirited debate", featuring contributions from academics, think-tanks, policy-makers and the voluntary and community sectors. At a time when the relationship between religion and public policy is highly visible and hotly contested, as recent debates over state funding for faith schools have shown, there is a need for accessible, relevant and recent research on and analysis of these issues. Addressing this need, Public Spirit provides a space for researchers, policymakers, politicians and practitioners from the voluntary and community sectors to access the latest research, engage in current debates and share expertise on key issues of faith and public policy. Hosted on the forum now are two themed debates: the first addresses the question: are Muslims effective participants in governance or are they victims of policies over which they have little say? The second theme asks: what are the implications of the Coalition government's emphasis on Christianity for a multi-faith society? In the coming months, Public Spirit will feature contributions from a wide range of authors on: the how and who of questions of religious representation; the implications of 'muscular liberalism' for faith and integration; the role of faith groups and values in social action; and finding the right balance between promoting equality and recognising religious difference. The project is led by Dr Therese O'Toole working with Dr Stephen Jones and the Centre's Director, Professor Tariq Modood. Subscribe to the Public Spirit by emailing subscribe@publicspirit.org.uk. Website: <http://www.publicspirit.org.uk/> The new "Database on Protection Against Statelessness in Europe", developed by the EUDO CITIZENSHIP Observatory in cooperation with UNHCR was launched in March 2013\. The database offers exhaustive information on the extent to which citizenship laws in 36 European states provide sufficient protection against statelessness in terms of international standards. For more information, see <http://eudo-citizenship.eu/databases/protection-against-statelessness> Minority Rights Group International released "Peoples under Threat 2013", its annual authoritative rankings table, which highlights those countries around the world where the risk of mass killing is greatest. Peoples under Threat is created by compiling data on the known antecedents to genocide or mass political killing, and seeks to predict what may happen in countries. As an early warning tool, Peoples under Threat has been widely used by UN officials and other human rights and conflict prevention practitioners. For more information, see <http://www.minorityrights.org/11989/peoples-under-threat/peoples-under-threat-2013.html> The final report and free learning resources are now available from the project Creating Citizenship Communities (funded by the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation). The aim of this research project is to identify current thinking and practice in schools; explore young people's perceptions and practice; and, through the development of a focused impact strategy encourage partnerships to be established between professionals and others. These resources and other materials are available from the project web pages <http://www.york.ac.uk/education/research/cresj/citizenship-communities/> The Inspirit Foundation has released its first discussion paper, "What Is Pluralism?"" The paper focuses on two questions: Why is pluralism important to social change? Can we speak of a "Canadian Pluralism"? The paper can be found in English and French on their website: <http://www.inspiritfoundation.org/en/about-inspirit/what_is_pluralism>
