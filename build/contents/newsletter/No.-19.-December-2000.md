The International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) is an Amsterdam-based association conducting comparative education studies since the 1960s. The IEA Civic Education Study is currently examining the values young people around the world are acquiring related to their roles as citizens in democracies and societies aspiring to democracy. The study covers three domains: (1) "Democracy, Democratic Institutions and Citizenship", (2) "National Identity and International Relations", and (3) "Social Cohesion and Diversity". The study has been conducted in two phases. Phase 1 (underway since 1993) consisted of mainly qualitative work such as interviews with experts on civic education, analyses of curriculum frameworks, and textbooks. In Phase 2, which took place in 1999, a number of students from nationally representative samples in twenty-eight countries were tested, with particular focus on knowledge, skills in interpreting political communication, concepts of democracy and citizenship etc. The results of Phase 1 have been published in: Judith Torney-Purta, John Schwille, and Jo-Ann Amadeo (eds) Civic Education across Countries: Twenty-four National Case Studies from the IEA Civic Education Study (IEA, Amsterdam, fax: 31 20 420 7136).
