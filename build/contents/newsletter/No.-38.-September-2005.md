#### 1\. Introduction

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year, research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a quarterly newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the thirty-eighth issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or non-governmental organizations.

If you would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, please contact us at <cded@post.queensu.ca>. Back-issues of the newsletter are posted on the Web on Will Kymlicka's home-page: <http://www.queensu.ca/cded/news.html>

#### 2\. POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP IN DEMOCRACY AND DIVERSITY

We are now inviting applications for the second year of the new postdoctoral fellowship program in "Democracy and Diversity" at Queen's University, funded in part by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. The program will run from 2005-2008\. Each year, one non-renewable 12-month fellowship will be awarded, working under the supervision of Prof. Will Kymlicka. The 2006-7 fellowship will commence on July 1, 2006\. The fellowship is part of a larger nexus of activities at Queen's relating to the normative and empirical study of democracy and diversity, including the Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy; the Research Group on Nationalism, Ethnicity and Multicultural Citizenship (www.queensu.ca/politics/rgonemc); the Fulbright Visiting Professorship in Nationalism, Ethnicity and Multicultural Citizenship; the Centre for the Study of Democracy; and the Institute of Intergovernmental Relations - all of which have active programs of workshops, conferences and visiting scholars and speakers. The Fellow would be expected to participate in these various activities as appropriate, including presentation of his or her research findings, and to assist Prof. Kymlicka in the Forum's activities. The Fellow would also be expected to do some teaching (two half-courses). While "Democracy and Diversity" is to be understood expansively, and there are no pre-determined limits on the topics it may cover, Queen's has a special expertise in issues of ethnocultural diversity. Recent and ongoing activities have covered such topics as immigration and citizenship, multiculturalism and multicultural education, indigenous rights, affirmative action, historic injustice, nationalism and secession, language rights, and transnational democracy. Applicants who combine normative analysis with empirical case studies are particularly welcome. Applications are due by March 1, 2006\. For application details, check the Philosophy Department website at: <http://www.queensu.ca/philosophy/>

#### 3\. CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND CRIMINAL LAW WORKSHOP

It will bring together experts in political theory and criminal law to discuss the ways in which the courts should take into account cultural difference when making judgements of responsibility and punishment in a criminal law context. Participants include Bhikhu Parekh, Matt Matravers, Michele Moody-Adams, Jeremy Waldron, Ayelet Shachar, Kimmo Nuotio, Heike Jung, Nicola Lacey, and Andrew von Hirsch.

"Federalism, Quebec and Francophone Minorities in Canada" is the name of a conference to be held at the University of Ottawa from March 9-11, 2006\. The event seeks to move beyond the recent debates on federalism, many of which have put "asymmetrical" federalism at the forefront. While francophone minorities support federalism, many are hesitant to endorse asymmetry. This conference will seek to answer questions such as; is asymmetrical federalism incompatible with the recognition of the rights of non-territorial minorities? How can these minorities position themselves in this debate? How can the Canadian debate on federalism benefit from international comparison, and/or be seen as a case study for the examination of the future of non-territorial minorities? The deadline for submissions is October 15, 2005\. For information, contact: Linda Cardinal, Chaire de recherche sur la francophonie et les politiques publiques, University of Ottawa, 550 Cumberland, Ottawa (Ontario) K1N 6N5; email: linda.cardinal@uottawa.ca
