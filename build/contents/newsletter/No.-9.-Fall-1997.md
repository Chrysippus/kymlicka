#### 1\. Introduction

The Canadian Centre for Philosophy and Public Policy (CCPPP) at the University of Ottawa is organizing a multi-year, inter-disciplinary research project on "Citizenship, Identity and Democracy in the Multiethnic State", under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the CCPPP will distribute a quarterly newletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the ninth issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or various non- governmental organizations.

- York University (Toronto) is hosting an international symposium on "Rights to the City: Citizenship, Democracy and Cities in a Global Age" on June 26-28 1998\. "Global cities" like Toronto, Vancouver, New York or Los Angeles have become sites of international flows of capital and labour. These global cities have been widely discussed as an economic issue, but this conference will focus on the other side of the global city - the postcolonial city, with its internally differentiated population, and new patterns of gender, class and ethnic segregation. This interdisciplinary symposium brings together international scholars to address the issues of citizenship, democracy and cities in a global age. What rights do immigrants, the poor, racial, ethnic, gender and youth groups have to the city and its institutions? What rights do citizens have in affecting the fate of their cities? Speakers include Benjamin Barber, Zygmunt Bauman, Saskia Sassen, Richard Sennett, Martin Thom, Bryan Turner, John Urry, Iris Marion Young, Nira Yuval-Davis.

Confirmed plenary speakers include Jacqueline Alexander, Susan Boyd, Angela Harris, Ratna Kapur, Ruthann Robson, Carol Smart, and Jeffrey Weeks. The developments in feminist legal theory, queer legal theory, and critical race theory have exposed the complex and often fluid relationship between law and the construction of the sexed and gendered subject.

#### 7\. Related Research Programs

Karen Eyben at the University of Ulster is conducting a three-year research project on the role of organizations in the public, private, voluntary and community sectors in confronting communal divisions in deeply divided societies. She is interested in the impact of operating in a deeply divided society both at the management level and in the production and delivery of goods and services; and in the experience of organizations which have made a strategic involvement in building peaceful relations in the larger society. She is hoping to establish links with people involved either theoretically or practically in similar work. She can be reached at: School of Social and Community Sciences, University of Ulster, Coleraine BT52 1SA, Northern Ireland. E-mail: <K.Eyben@ulst.ac.uk>

- In newsletter #7, we mentioned that the Council for Cultural Cooperation (CDCC) of the Council of Europe has just concluded a four-year project on "Democracy, Human Rights, Minorities: Educational and Cultural Aspects", resulting in an eight-page Declaration which "clarifies the basic concepts of intercultural democracy based on the recognition of the rights and duties of cultural communities interacting with each other". This project has now been merged into a new project on "Education for Democratic Citizenship", which aims to propose ways to promote education in intercultural democracy. The first event in this project will be a seminar on the "Basic Concepts and core competencies of democratic citizenship", in Strasbourg on December 11-12, 1997\. The keynote speaker will be Alain Touraine.
