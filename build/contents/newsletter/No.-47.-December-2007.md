#### 6\. Related Research Programs

EroEthos is a new project directed by the University of Trento (Italy) that focuses on "Exploring the Scope for a Shared European Pluralistic Ethos: A comparative investigation of religious and secular ethically-derived requests for exemption from the law in an enlarging Europe". The goal is to explore the possible scope for a shared European ethos through the analysis of political and legal questions concerning issues of religious and secular ethics-based requests for exemption from the law, in the belief that the study of such issues provide important indications of how societies handle a plurality of values. The project's website contains a database of cases of conscientious objection, civil disobedience and legal requests for exemptions, which is available upon registration: <http://euroethos.lett.unitn.it/>
