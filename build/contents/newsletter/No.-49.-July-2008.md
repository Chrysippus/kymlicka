The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a quarterly newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the forty-ninth issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or non-governmental organizations. If you would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, please contact us at cded@queensu.ca.

#### 2\. Upcoming Conferences

The "Diasporas: Exploring Critical Issues" project is holding its 1st Global Conference on 5-7 July 2008 at Mansfield College in Oxford. The conference will explore the contemporary experience of Diasporas – communities who conceive of themselves as a national, ethnic, linguistic or other form of cultural and political construction of collective membership living outside of their 'home lands.' Key issues to be addressed include: what are the defining characteristics of Diasporas and what distinguishes one from the other? What role do 'home' and 'host' cultures play in developing relationships between communities in a global environment? Does the concept of Diasporas capture new global realities or designate old phenomena in a new way? For the conference program, and information about the project generally, see: <http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/ci/transformations/diasporas/d1/prog.html>
