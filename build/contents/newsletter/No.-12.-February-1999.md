#### 1\. Introduction

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year, research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka.

#### 7\. Related Research Projects

For those working on the relationship between federalism and diversity, there are two new projects which may be of interest:

The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) has decided to stimulate research, training and dissemination on issues of federalism and federations, and is offering an extensive grants program for people working in this area. It includes grants for doctoral and postdoctoral fellowships, aid to conferences, research grants and virtual institute grants. For more information, contact the Federalism and Federations Program at: <federations@sshrc.ca>, or visit the Program website: <http://www.sshrc.ca/english/programinfo/grantsguide/fed-overview.html>

The Committee for a Forum on Federations (CIFF) is an NGO promoting the creation of an international Forum of Federations, bringing together policymakers and practitioners of federalism to exchange information and compare experiences, and to assist new or emerging federations. The first major step will be an international conference on federalism in Mont Tremblant, Quebec on October 6-8 1998, which will bring together elected representatives, civil servants, academics and private sector representatives from most of the world's federal countries. "Citizenship and Social Diversity" will be one of the four major themes of the conference.
