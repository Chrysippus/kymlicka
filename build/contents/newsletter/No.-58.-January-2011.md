#### 1\. Introduction

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year, research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a quarterly newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the fifty-eighth issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or non-governmental organizations.

If you would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, please contact us at cded@queensu.ca. Back-issues of the newsletter are posted on the Web on Will Kymlicka's home-page: <http://www.queensu.ca/cded/news.html>

#### 2\. Workshop on Minority Rights in the Arab World

The Forum is pleased to be co-organizing a workshop on Minority Rights and Multiculturalism in the Arab World, to be held in Rome on March 25-26, 2011, co-hosted by LUISS University ([http://www.luiss.it](http://www.luiss.it/)) and the Istituto di Studi Politici S. Pio V ([http://www.istitutospiov.it](http://www.istitutospiov.it/)). This event is being co-organized by Will Kymlicka (Queen's University), Sebastiano Maffetone (LUISS), Eva Pfoestl (Istituto di Studi Politici S. Pio V&), and Francesca Corrao (Naples University; Orientale). The goal is to explore how issues of ethnic diversity are conceptualized and debated in Arab-majority countries, and how this relates to emerging global discourses of multiculturalism and minority rights. Participants include Joshua Castellino, Jacob Mundy, Zaid Eyadat, Janet Klein, Hassan Jabareen, Joseph Yacoub, Fahima Charafeddine, Hassan Hanafi and Adonis. For more information, please contact either Will Kymlicka (<kymlicka@queensu.ca>) or Eva Pfoestl (<eva.pfoestl@istitutospiov.it>).

The 13th National Metropolis Conference will take place at the Sheraton Wall Centre, Vancouver, BC, between March 23-March 26, 2011, on the theme "Immigration: Bringing the World to Canada". A recent report by Statistics Canada projects that, by 2031, at least one in four Canadians will have been born in another country. With this remarkable feature of our society as a backdrop, the conference will discuss the scale and nature of Canada's immigration system and the policies and practices that have emerged to foster the socio-economic inclusion of new Canadians. For further details, see the conference website at [http://www.metropolis2011.net](http://www.metropolis2011.net/).

"Writing Democracy: A Rhetoric of (T)Here" is the theme for the 2011 Federation Rhetoric Symposium, which will take place between March 9-11 2011 at the Texas A&M University campus at Commerce, Texas. Keynote Speakers include Nancy Welch, David Gold, John Duffy, David Jolliffe, and Michelle Hall Kells, Elenore Long, and Jerrold Hirsch. For more information see the website at <http://writingdemocracy.weebly.com/>.

The UCLA School of Law's Critical Race Studies Program is now accepting proposals for its 5th Annual Academic Symposium to be held on March 31st - April 2, 2011, on the theme Race and Sovereignty.Sovereignty, like race, has been invoked, understood, and deployed in contradictory ways. Historically, sovereignty has been an important vehicle through which hegemonic power has been enforced, for example, by articulating citizenship as a racial project rooted in the power to exclude. Sovereignty has also been an important tool of anti-colonial resistance crucial to liberatory struggles of people of color in the U.S. and worldwide. Race shares this complex dimension, serving as both a technology of oppression and a vehicle for resistance to that oppression. Despite these parallels, race and sovereignty have, for the most part, been engaged as separate and mutually exclusive projects: sovereignty has primarily been linked to the struggles of Native Americans and other indigenous peoples, while the struggles of other people of color have largely been cast through a standard anti-racist narrative of citizenship and inclusion. Proposals are due January 7, 2011\. To view the current program, confirmed speakers, submissions requirements and deadlines, and registration information, please visit: <http://www.law.ucla.edu/home/index.asp?page=3542>.

The National Institute for the Study of Dutch Slavery and its Legacy and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam are pleased to announce the fourth annual Summer School on Black Europe entitled "Black Europe: Exploring Dimensions of Citizenship, Race and Ethnic Relations", to be held on June 12-30 2011 in Amsterdam. The Summer School on Black Europe emerged out of dialogue and concern of various scholars working in the field of race and ethnic relations in Europe, and is now in its fourth year. This course will examine the multiple constructions of the term Black Europe and the social, economic and political implications within. If you are interested in hearing more about the course, please send a request for additional information via email to <a.abdou@ninsee.nl>. Or visit the website, <http://www.ninsee.nl/Summerschool-1>

The Central European University's Summer University will offer a course on "The Politics of Ethnicity, Nationality and Citizenship" from June 27 to July 8, 2011\. The application deadline is 15 February, 2011\. Recent years have seen an explosion of empirical and normative scholarly interest in citizenship across many disciplines. This course seeks to provide an overview of some of the main topical issues and scholarly perspectives in citizenship studies, with a special emphasis on the legal and political aspects of citizenship policies in the European Union member states. Given the special circumstances of new state formation and state succession in large parts of Eastern Europe after 1989, special attention will be given to problems of membership, ethnic selectivity, transnational and dual citizenship with their implications on the de- or re-ethnicization of citizenship. In addition, the course will also focus on the debates related to the inclusion and exclusion of immigrants. Several course faculty are members of the European Commission funded EUDO Citizenship project, a research network which focuses on citizenship policies in the EU member states and Eastern and Southern borderlines (fSU, Turkey, fRY) of the Union.

ACCEPT is a new research project at the Centre for the Study of Ethnicity and Citizenship, funded by the European Commissionâ€™s Seventh Framework Programme. It starts from the realization that in recent years there have been increasing tensions between national majorities and ethnic or religious minorities across Europe. It asks how cultural difference is debated and tolerated, respected or rejected in 15 European countries. In studying the conditions of tolerance and respect, it also explores how much cultural difference can be accommodated within liberal and secular democracies. The British contribution to this project is run by Professor Tariq Modood (Principal Investigator), Jan Dobbernack and Dr. Nasar Meer.The Hungarian part is run by Jon Fox (Principal Investigator), Aniko Horvath and Zsuzsa Vidra.
