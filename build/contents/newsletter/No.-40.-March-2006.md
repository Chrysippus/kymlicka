#### 1\. Introduction

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year, research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a quarterly newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the fortieth issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or non-governmental organizations.

If you would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, please contact us at cded@post.queensu.ca. Back-issues of the newsletter are posted on the Web on Will Kymlicka's home-page: <http://www.queensu.ca/cded/news.html>

#### 2\. WORKSHOP ON RECONCILIATION AND MULTICULTURALISM

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a workshop on "The Politics of Reconciliation in Multicultural Societies" at Queen's on April 29-30, 2006\. The workshop is part of a project to explore the areas of convergence and disagreement between recent theories of the politics of reconciliation in divided societies, and recent theories of multicultural citizenship in culturally diverse societies. Under what conditions does the politics of reparations/reconciliation support the politics of multicultural recognition, and under what conditions do these different forms of politics conflict? Participants include Ruth Rubio-Marin, Paul Muldoon, Nadim Rouhana, Eric Yamamoto, Lawrie Balfour, Jonathan VanAntwerpen, Ayelet Shachar, and Sonali Thakkar. For further information, contact the co-organizers, Will Kymlicka (kymlicka@post.queensu.ca) or Bashir Bashir (bashir@post.queensu.ca).
