#### 1\. Introduction

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year, research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a quarterly newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the fifteenth issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or various non-governmental organizations.

If you know anyone who would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, or if you would like copies of the back-issues, please contact us at <cded@post.queensu.ca>. For further information about the research project, you can also reach us by fax at 613-533-6545.

#### 5\. Internet Resources

As part of the LGI Managing Multiethnic Communities Project a Virtual Library of Internet resources on national and ethnic minorities in Central and Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union has been created. The aim of this database is to provide guidance and assistance in accessing information on national and ethnic minorities in Central and Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union. The virtual library includes the most comprehensive list of websites on this topic. The electronic library welcomes contributions by users, as well as suggestions and comments. Those who would like to send new entries to the database can do so either directly from the website by using the on-line feedback form or by sending an e-mail to Andrea Krizsn: <pphkril14@phd.ceu.hu> Visit: <http://www.osi.hu/lgi/ethnic/weblibrary/index.html>

A new mailing list has been set up to facilitate discussion within the field of Ethnopolitics by encouraging exchange between academics and practitioners on issues related to (non-immigrant) ethnic minorities, minority rights, and the origin, development and settlement of ethnic conflicts. To subscribe, go to: <http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/ethnopolitics/>

As we noted in newsletter #10, the Council of Europe's "Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities" was a major development in the international protection of minorities, since the Convention has some real legal force, unlike most of the other recent international declarations on minority rights, which remain mere declarations. On the other hand, the vagueness of the concepts contained within the Convention, and the number of reservations made by the signatory countries, shows how difficult it is to find a formula which will cover the very different needs and circumstances of minority groups in different countries. This Framework Convention will be a test-case for the possibility of building minority rights into the general system of human rights and international law. The European Centre for Minority Issues (ECMI) has just issued an interesting report entitled "Implementing the Framework Convention", examining what has happened since the Convention came into legal force in 1998\. The report can be downloaded from the ECMI website: <http://www.ecmi.de/publications.htm> For the text of the Convention itself, see <http://www.coe.fr/eng/legaltxt/157e.htm>

The Centre for the Study of Ethnicity and Citizenship is a new interdisciplinary centre located in the department of Sociology at the University of Bristol, UK. The Centre, whose aim is to provide a home for interdisciplinary work on ethnicity and citizenship, has been set up in recognition of the importance of ethnicity to the study of contemporary societies and polities, and prospects for social justice and social cohesion. The centre promotes research in two broad areas: a) Ethnicity and state structures, cultural pluralism and its institutionalisation, the politics of multiculturalism and other forms of "difference", including gendered ethnicity and ethno-religious identities, minority rights and human rights, challenges to secularism, the nation-state and other aspects of conceptions of citizenship; b) Ethnicity and socio-economic structures with focus on racialized exclusion, inter-generational poverty, labour markets, health, education, ethnic stratification and social mobility, ethnic competition and ethnic networks as a local, national and transnational economic resources. The Centre for the Study of Ethnicity and Citizenship promotes the study of ethnicity through funded research, publications, conferences, and seminars. It will host an international journal, "Etnicities", published by Sage from 2001\.

A Joint Programme between the European Commission and the Council of Europe has been established on "National Minorities in Europe". This program is a co-operation between European countries in the field of national minorities. This joint program has been created as a follow up to the Action Plan adopted in October 1997 at the Second Summit of Heads of State and Government of Council of Europe member States. An initial Joint Programme between the European Commission and the Council of Europe, entitled "Minorities in Central European Countries", was carried out between the second half of 1996 and early 1998 as a measure to support the Stability Pact. In view of the success of the First Joint programme, a second programme has been launched for the period January 1999 June 2000\. This programme has four new aspects: it is open to all Council of Europe member States and applicant States; it is based on a thematic approach (media, education, participation in decision-making processes etc.); it concerns sub-regional or bilateral projects; it envisages greater participation by representatives of national minorities.
