We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or various non-governmental organizations.

The Key Centre for Ethics, Law, Justice and Governance in Queensland, Australia has started a major research program on "Citizenship and Governance in a Changing Global Order", under the direction of Charles Sampford. In addition, the centre pursues a program on "Indigenous People and the Governance of Society", directed by Prof. Ciaran O'Faircheallaigh. This program considers the ways in which indigenous peoples have governed, and continue to govern, their communities and reflects on the underlying foundational values and concepts of community. In so doing, it asks what insights these values might offer for western governance, and offers indigenous lawyers the opportunity to consider what elements of western notions of governance might be useful for the development of indigenous governance.
