#### 1\. Introduction

The Canadian Centre for Philosophy and Public Policy (CCPPP) at the University of Ottawa has begun a multi-year, inter-disciplinary research project on "Citizenship, Identity and Democracy in the Multiethnic State", under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the CCPPP will distribute a quarterly newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the inaugural issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or various non-governmental organizations. There is a great deal of work being done, inside and outside academia, on issues of democracy and ethnocultural diversity. Some of the other research groups currently working in this field are listed in section 2, along with their primary areas of research. The distinctive focus of our project is on normative and theoretical questions, rather than empirical or explanatory issues. Our focus is on identifying the challenges which ethnocultural diversity raises for the underlying norms of a liberal democratic society like Canada, including principles of democracy, justice, equality, freedom, rights and citizenship. To what extent can or should these principles be reinterpreted so as to accommodate an increasingly multiethnic citizenry? Can greater recognition and protection be afforded to group differences without sacrificing traditional concerns with equality, non-discrimination, individual rights, and social unity? We will be pursuing these questions primarily in the Canadian context, focusing in particular on Canada's immigration and naturalization policy, Aboriginal rights, official bilingualism, Quebecois nationalism, multicultural educational reform, affirmative action, and other related topics. While our focus is on the Canadian context, comparisons with other countries will be a vital component of our research.

In future newsletters, we will discuss some of the findings of our research. In this inaugural issue, however, our focus is on listing information about other related programs, upcoming conferences, and recent publications which may be of interest to people working in the field.

#### 5\. Internet Resources

This is the "home page" of Canada's Department of Citizenship and Immigration. It includes information about recent Department policy documents (some of which can be downloaded), as well as an overview of the "Metropolis" research project - a very ambitious research program studying the impact of immigration on large cities, which links academic researchers and government officials in several countries, including Canada, Australia, United States and Italy.

<http://www.ercomer.org/>

This is the home page of the European Research Centre on Migration and Ethnic Relations (ERCOMER), based at the University of Utrecht, which is the largest research centre of its kind in Europe. The home page provides information on the various research projects being undertaken at ERCOMER, including studies of ethnic conflict, refugee movements, immigrant labourers, and multicultural education. It also includes information on the Centre's publications, including how to get on the mailing list for their newsletter, and on the Centre's staff, seminar series, and upcoming conferences.
