The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year, research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka.

We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or various non-governmental organizations.
