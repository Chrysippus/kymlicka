The Canadian Centre for Philosophy and Public Policy (CCPPP) at the University of Ottawa is organizing a multi- year, inter-disciplinary research project on "Citizenship, Identity and Democracy in the Multiethnic State", under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the CCPPP is distributing a quarterly newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the tenth issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or various non-governmental organizations.

#### 5\. New Journals

The long-standing journal _New Community_ is changing its name to the _Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies_, as of Volume 24, January 1998, to better reflect its content. It will continue to focus on research on all forms of migration, ethnic conflict, discrimination, nationalism, citizenship, and policies of integration. However, it now is particularly interested in articles with a comparative perspective, either within Europe or comparing one or more European countries with the countries of North America and the Asia-Pacific.

It is edited by Malcolm Cross, of the European Research Centre on Migration and Ethnic Relations (ERCOMER), and is published by Carfax.

Carfax has also started publishing two other journals which might be of interest. The first is called _Race Ethnicity and Education_. It is a new journal focusing on the dynamics of race and ethnicity in education. It is edited by Dr. David Gilborn, Institute of Education, University of London, 55-59 Gordon Square, London WC1H 0NT, U.K. The journal interprets education in the widest sense, and includes perspectives from sociology, anthropology, history, gender and sexuality.

The second is entitled _Communal/Plural: Journal of Transnational and CrossCultural Studies_. It is concerned with social identification and communal formation around the world. It is edited by Ghassan Hage and Lesley Johnson.

More information about all three of these journals, including instructions for authors and contents of past issues, can be found at the Carfax website: <http://www.carfax.co.uk>

#### 6\. Internet Resources

<http://www.coe.fr/eng/legaltxt/157e.htm> On February 1, 1998, the Council of Europe's "Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities" entered into legal force. (The Convention was signed in 1995, but only entered into legal force when twelve countries ratified it, which occurred last month). This website gives the full text of the Convention, and includes a list of all the countries which have ratified it (including their reservations, if any). This is, arguably, a major development in the international protection of minorities, since the Convention now has some real legal force, unlike most of the other recent international declarations on minority rights, which remain mere declarations (such as the 1992 UN Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, or the 1988 UN Draft Universal Declaration on Indigenous Rights, or the Council of Europe's own previous European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages). On the other hand, the vagueness of the concepts contained within the Convention, and the number of reservations made by the signatory countries, shows how difficult it is to find a formula which will cover the very different needs and circumstances of minority groups in different countries. This Framework Convention will be an interesting test-case for the possibility of building minority rights into the general system of human rights and international law.
