The conference will examine how liberal theory is being shaped by this conflict, and to survey different practical and principled ways to respond to the problem. The conference is organized by Avigail Eisenberg and Jeff Spinner-Halev, in conjunction with the Departments of Political Science, Women's Studies and the Human Rights and Human Diversity Initiative of the University of Nebraska.

Keynote speakers include Sabine Broek, Jose Casanova, and John Keane. This conference will explore what the 'transatlantic' means for the people of Africa, the Americas, and Europe, focusing on three inter-locking dimensions of the transatlantic experience. Firstly, at a time when globalisation raises concerns about the impact of westernisation or, more specifically, Americanisation on the rest of the world, the conference will ask what a study of the transatlantic can tell us about how people have adapted to cultural exchanges in the past. Secondly, the conference will examine the transatlantic experience as a focus of scholarly or artistic practice. Finally, the conference will ask what we can learn by the comparative experiences on the different sides of the Atlantic. What, for example, can comparative studies tell us about the relative experience of citizenship, nation, and race?
