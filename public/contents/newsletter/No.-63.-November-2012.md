#### 1\. Introduction

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year, research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the sixty-third issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or non-governmental organizations.

There will be a conference on "Democracy and Diversity in Education" at Buskerud University College, Norway on 13 March 2013\. The special invited guest will be Dr James A. Banks of the University of Washington in Seattle. The main topic for the conference is: How are democracy and diversity (and the relationship between these concepts) understood in society and in school? The conference aims to bring together existing research in these fields and consider ways in which education for democracy and democratic citizenship might be strengthened in the context of diversity. We invite papers from scholars in Norway and internationally on the themes of democracy and diversity in education, and particularly the intersection between these two areas of scholarship. Further information is available at: <http://www.hibu.no/citizenship/conference/>.

"The Impact of Religion: Challenges for Society, Law and Democracy" is an interdisciplinary conference to be hosted at Uppsala University in Uppsala, Sweden on 20-22 May 2013\.

There will be an international conference on "Ethnicity, Race and Nationalism in European Media and Film: Rights, Responsibilities, Representations", held at the University of Manchester, UK on 23-25 May 2013\. The European media play a crucial role both in exacerbating the tensions which inter-ethnic relations arouse (the spread of racial hate language and nationalist extremism on the internet; the use of ethnic profiling and racial stereotyping in crime reporting), and in fostering inter-ethnic cohesion and harmony (national policies on promoting diversity and equality in broadcasting).This conference aims to facilitate a cross-cultural, comparative study of the impact of media and film on the playing out of the "crisis of multiculturalism" in West and East European societies, and to analyse the similarities and differences in media and cinematic approaches to ethnic cohesion issues throughout Europe. For more information, visit <http://www.russtvethnic.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/events/#call_for_papers>.

The International Academic Forum in conjunction with its global partners, including the Cultural Studies Association of Australasia, is organizing the Third Asian Conference on Cultural Studies, to be held from May 24-26 2013, in Osaka, Japan. The conference theme is "Intersecting Belongings: Cultural Conviviality and Cosmopolitan Futures". These are times when trans-cultural, trans-national and multicultural belonging are particularly being tested through environmental catastrophe, economic volatility, parochialism, fundamentalism, notions of cosmopolitan and multicultural exhaustion, and war. A key challenge lies in the paradox of culture, in which belonging has become a fundamental question of preservation, atavism, tradition and survival as well as hybridity, transgression, possibility and transformation. The aim of this conference is to respond to this paradoxical challenge by opening up discussion, critical reflection and analysis about emerging social and cultural identities that are formed at the intersection of multiple and multi-sited belongings. For more information, visit <http://www.accs.iafor.org/>.
