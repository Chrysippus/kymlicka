The International Metropolis Project is organizing a conference on "Multicultural Futures" on September 22-23, 2004, in Prato, Italy (outside Florence). Multiculturalism theory and practice are now under severe criticism from both the left and the right.

The International Metropolis Project, the Monash Institute for the Study of Global Movements, and the Australian Multicultural Foundation have organized a conference to take a hard look at the future viability of multiculturalism as a means of bringing about the effective integration of immigrants and creating cohesive societies that have diverse populations. Speakers include Veit Bader, Will Kymlicka, Aristide Zolberg, Rainer Baubock, Graeme Hugo, Trevor Phillips, and a number of government ministers. The conference is immediately prior to the 9th International Metropolis Conference which takes place in Geneva from September 27-October 1.
