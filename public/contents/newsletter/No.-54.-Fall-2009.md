#### 1\. [Introduction]

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year, research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a quarterly newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the fifty-fourth issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or non- governmental organizations.

If you would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, please contact us at <cded@queensu.ca>. Back-issues of the newsletter are posted on the Web on Will Kymlicka's home-page: <http://post.queensu.ca/~kymlicka/ddnewsletter.php>

#### 2\. [Postdoctoral Fellowship in Democracy and Diversity]

We are now inviting applications for the sixth year of the postdoctoral fellowship program in "Democracy and Diversity" at Queen's University, funded in part by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. Each year, one non-renewable 12-month fellowship will be awarded. The fellow will work under the supervision of Prof. Will Kymlicka. The 2010-11 fellowship will start on July 1, 2010\. Applicants must have submitted their doctoral dissertation by that date, and must be within five years of having received their doctorate. The salary for the postdoctoral fellowship will be \$34,000 (Canadian), which includes remuneration for teaching a half-course in political philosophy or a cognate subject. The fellowship is part of a larger nexus of activities at Queen's relating to the normative and empirical study of democracy and diversity, including the Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy; the Ethnicity and Democratic Governance project ([www.queensu.ca/edg/](http://www.queensu.ca/edg/)) the Fulbright Visiting Professorship in Nationalism, Ethnicity and Multicultural Citizenship; the Centre for the Study of Democracy; and the Institute of Intergovernmental Relations - all of which have active programs of workshops, conferences and visiting scholars and speakers. The Fellow would be expected to participate in these various activities as appropriate, including presentation of his or her research findings, and to assist Prof. Kymlicka in the Forum's activities. While "Democracy and Diversity" is to be understood expansively, and there are no pre-determined limits on the topics it may cover, Queen's has a special expertise in issues of ethnocultural diversity. Recent and ongoing activities have covered such topics as immigration and citizenship, multiculturalism and multicultural education, indigenous rights, affirmative action, historic injustice, nationalism and secession, language rights, and transnational democracy. Applicants who combine normative analysis with empirical case studies are particularly welcome. Applications should include a curriculum vitae, together with a statement of research interests, a teaching dossier, and a writing sample. Applications should be sent to the Department of Philosophy, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada, K7L 3N6, to arrive by February 1, 2010\. It is the responsibility of the applicants to have three letters of reference sent directly by their referees. References may be mailed to the postal address above, or sent by email to <kymlicka@queensu.ca>. Further information is available on the Department's website: (<http://www.queensu.ca/philosophy/jobs.php>)

#### 3\. Upcoming Conferences

The EUROSPHERE Project is hosting an international conference on "Towards a Diverse European Public Sphere? Theoretical Puzzles and Empirical Evidences", on 13 - 14 November 2009, in Osnabruck, Germany. After almost three years of work, the EUROSPHERE project will present its first results at the conference. The conference will focus on two major thematic issues: Does a European Public Sphere (EPS) exist and how can it be approached? What are the challenges and consequences of diversity for EPS (and vice versa)? More information about the conference, including the programme and registration, can be found at: <http://www.imis.uni-osnabrueck.de/EurosphereConference.htm>. More information about the EUROSPHERE project can be found at: <http://www.eurosphere.uib.no>.

The Naumann Stiftung and the European Centre for Minority Issues are organizing an international conference on "Demos or Ethnos? Multi-Ethnic Societies as Challenges to Liberal Democracy" in Hamburg, Germany on 20 November 2009\. Since the 1980s, traditional democracies based on the nation-state have been under siege, confronted by the model of "multicultural democracy." However, there are also opposing tendencies such as the strengthening of ethnic hegemony in what Sammy Smooha calls regimes of "ethnic democracy", which combine the principle of equality of all citizens with the recognition of special privileges for one ethnic group. Since this concept has been developed, its application to Israel and other multiethnic countries has been the subject of intense discussion. These issues will be examined at the conference from the standpoint of democratic theory as well as political practice. Are so-called "ethnic democracies" stable? How should rights of representation and participation of various groups be regulated? Which provisions in multiethnic societies have been found to contribute to peace and stability? And what contributions can be made by supranational organizations such as the European Union? Further details can be found here: <http://tinyurl.com/ykep8a6>.

The Ethnicity and Democratic Governance Project (EDG) is hosting its second public conference on the theme of "Globalization, Urbanization, and Ethnicity", on December 3rd - 4th, 2009 in Ottawa. With more than half the human race living in cities for the first time in history, and with the multi-ethnic and multi-cultural character of all major cities increasing rapidly, the democratic governance of ethnic diversity at the city level has become a major issue for scholars and policy-makers alike. How can we govern cities in ways that maintain social cohesion and draw on the assets of all cultural/ethnic groups in times of increasing diversity? Speakers will examine this issue in a range of contexts (Europe, North America, the Global South), looking not only at "new" diversity due to immigration, but also at how migration is affecting older ethnic, racial and religious cleavages within divided cities. For more information, visit the conference website at: <http://www.queensu.ca/edg/2009.html>.

The Refugee Studies Centre at the University of Oxford is hosting an international conference on "Deportation and the Development of Citizenship", on 11-12 December 2009, convened by Dr Bridget Anderson (COMPAS), Dr Matthew Gibney and Dr Emanuela Paoletti (RSC). The aim of this conference is to encourage interdisciplinary and comparative scholarship on deportation, broadly conceived as the lawful expulsion power of states, both as an immigration control and as a social control mechanism. The conference will serve as a vehicle for bringing together scholars from a range of disciplines, including politics, sociology, history, international relations, law, criminology and anthropology, interested in the study of deportation. For more information, visit <http://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk>.

The Centre for Ethnicity and Citizenship at the University of Bristol is hosting "The Politics of Misrecognition: An Interdisciplinary Conference" on 22-23 January 2010\. Keynote speakers include Axel Honneth, Michel Seymour and Melissa Williams. What is 'misrecognition' and why does it matter? This conference aims to explore this question, and to consider how the idea of misrecognition can help us understand the interaction and political orientations of different cultures, social movements and state policies. Conference organizers are Wendy Martineau (University of Bristol), Nasar Meer (University of Southampton) and Simon Thompson (University of the West of England, Bristol). For more information, visit: <http://www.bristol.ac.uk/sociology/ethnicitycitizenship/misrecognition>, or contact the organizers by email at: <simon.thompson@uwe.ac.uk>.

Jadavpur University is hosting a conference on "Land of Promise: Stories of the Immigrant in Multicultural Canada" in Kolkata, India, from February 3-5, 2010\. The conference would like to initiate a dialogue between the local and the global and highlight concerns within the concept of Multiculturalism in Canada. It will also address the dialectical relationship between race, gender and nation in the context of contemporary politics, philosophies and literatures. Papers are invited in all areas relating to the general theme of the conference and can be sent by email to <canacentreju@gmail.com>. For more information, contact Prof. Suchorita Chattopadhyay at the above email address or visit website <http://www.h-net.org/announce/show.cgi?ID=171594>.

NIpissing University is hosting a conference on the truth and reconciliation process set up in Canada to deal with the legacy of Aboriginal residential schools. The conference, entitled "Commissioning Possibilities: Truth, Reconciliation and the Residential Schools", will be held at Nipissing University, North Bay (Ontario), in the territory of the Anishinabek Nation, from March 5-7, 2010\. It will bring together a range of communities: Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, scholarly, activist, artistic, policy and service-oriented, to advance a series of critical and constructive conversations about the possibilities of truth and reconciliation. For more information, visit: <http://www.h-net.org/announce/show.cgi?ID=170513>, or <http://www.nipissingu.ca/TRCconference/>, or send an email to Dr. Rosemary Nagy or Dr. Robinder Sehdev at <TRCconference@nipissingu.ca>.

The 12th Annual National Metropolis Conference will take place in Montreal on March 18-21, 2010, on the theme "Immigration and Diversity: Crossroads of Cultures, Engine of Economic Development".

For more information, visit the conference website: <http://www.metropolis2010.net>.

The research centre MIGRINTER and MINORITYMEDIA at the University of Poitiers are organizing an international conference on "An Alternative Self-Representation: Ethnic Minority Media between hegemony and resistance" on 18-19 March, 2010, in Poitiers, France. Keynote speakers will include Sirma Bilge, Robin Cohen, and Daya Thussu. For more information, visit: [http://www.minoritymedia.eu/spip.php?article959⟨=en](http://www.minoritymedia.eu/spip.php?article959&lang=en).

One of the workshops at the 2010 ECPR (European Consortium for Political Research) in Munster on 22-27 March 2010 will focus on "Ethno-linguistic Mobilisation and Regional Languages in Europe: Towards Recognition?". Although language is a fundamental issue in contemporary societies, it remains relatively unaddressed by political scientists. The aim of this workshop is to explore the different strategies used by linguistic movements to make their regional languages recognised in Europe. From a broader perspective, after the decline of the pure Westphalian state and the rise of the neo-liberal state, are we witnessing the emergence of a new model of the state in Europe, one characterised by a growing language pluralism? Any such change is a matter of empirical investigation and theoretical reflection, the dual aims of this workshop. Prospective participants should send a proposal to one of the workshop directors: Alistair Cole, Cardiff University (<coleA@cardiff.ac.uk>) and Jean-Baptiste Harguindeguy, Centro de Estudios Politicos y Constitucionales (<jean-baptiste.harguindeguy@eui.eu>). For more information visit: <http://www.ecprnet.eu/joint_sessions/munster/workshop_details.asp?workshopID=10>.

The 7th Annual Conference in Citizenship Studies will be held at Wayne State University, in Detroit on April 8-10, 2010, on the theme "Networks and Citizenship". Citizenship requires networks and networks can confer citizenship. The theme of the 2010 conference of the Center for the Study of Citizenship explores the similarities and the tensions between networks and citizenship in the past, present, and future. It also considers how networks have shaped citizenship and how citizenship has influenced the development of networks. Noted scholar Yochai Benkler (Harvard University and author of The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom) will give the keynote speech. We welcome proposals from any time period or geographic area and across the widest range of disciplines from faculty, graduate students, and independent scholars. Questions should be directed to Marc W. Kruman, <aa1277@wayne.edu>. For more information, visit: <http://www.clas.wayne.edu/citizenship/>.

For more information, visit the conference website at <http://www.nationalities.org>.

The Official Languages and Bilingualism Institute (OLBI) at the University of Ottawa is hosting a conference on "Individual Plurilingualism and Multilingual Communities in a context of official bilingualism", on April 29-30, 2010\. The colloquium will examine the evolution and future of individual plurilingualism within the multilingual communities of Canada in a context of official bilingualism. Canada, among the industrialized countries, has one of the highest rates of bilingualism or individual plurilingualism in a context of social multilingualism. The linguistic reality of the country is imprinted by the coexistence of multiple communities whose members have a variety of linguistic repertoires, not only Canadian official languages (French and English) but also native languages and heritage languages. This reality involves dynamics of languages in contact, language use, language teaching, and language planning and policies. The goal of this colloquium is to explore the present and the future of these communities and their community institutions in the context of official bilingualism. Proposals should be submitted by December 18, 2009 to <http://www.olbi.uottawa.ca/call-conference2010.html>. For more information, contact Aline Germain-Rutherford at <ccerbal@uottawa.ca>.

The Asian Law Institute (ASLI) and the Ahmad Ibrahim Kulliyyah of Laws, International Islamic University, Malaysia are holding the 7th Annual ASLI conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on 25-26 May 2010 on the theme of "Law in a Pluralist Asia: Challenges and Prospects". Asia is arguably the most pluralist region in the world and law has a critical role in accommodating and managing this plurality, which exists at so many levels.The purpose of this annual conference is to bring together scholars of Asian law from within and outside Asia to interact, share ideas and build collegial networks which may facilitate ongoing dialogue and research collaborations. Please visit the conference web site at: <http://law.nus.edu.sg/asli/7th_asli_conf/index.html>.

The Department of Political Science at Stockholm Univeristy is organizing a conference on "The Dynamics of Citizenship in the Post-Political World" in Stockholm on May 26-28, 2010\. This conference invites scholars to theoretically, empirically, and critically study the idea and reality of citizenship in the post-political world. It takes as its point of departure two important processes--de-politicization and politicization--and explores their impact on citizenship. The process of "de-politicization" entails the decreasing centrality of the state (nation-state parliamentary actors and government institutions) in protecting and providing for its citizens, guaranteeing them social and environmental rights, and regulating the allocation of common values and resources in global society. The process of "politicization" concerns the political responsibility given to non-governmental actors and institutions as well as the political role of personal life and societal roles other than the voter. There will be workshops on (1) citizenship gaps; (2) post-political participation; (3) human rights and European and global citizenship; (4) global economy and citizenship and (5) citizenship as new notions of belonging and identity. Organized by Michele Micheletti (<http://www.statsvet.su.se/micheletti>). For more information, visit the conference website: <http://www.statsvet.su.se/English/Research/citizenship_conference.html>.

The Center for Democracy in Aarau (Switzerland) will be hosting an international conference called "Switzerland: A Nation-State or a Multi-Nation State?" on May 7-8, 2010, convened by Marc Helbling and Nenad Stojanovic. Is Switzerland a nation-state? If not, is it a multinational state? Which elements are missing for Switzerland to become a real nation-state? If yes, what kind of nation-state is Switzerland? Does it constitute a nation-state comparable to those surrounding it or should it be considered as a Sondernation, a "special case"? From another perspective it might be asked whether Switzerland defies some of the fundamental laws of nation-states. While some consider Switzerland as a civic nation or a "nation of will" (because of its alleged cultural heterogeneity), others clearly observe a case of ethnic nationalism (because of its restrictive naturalization policy). To what extent is the Swiss case suited to bringing out the limitations of such typologies? Does the Swiss case provide an opportunity to revise existing theories in nationalism? The conference will bring together political scientists, sociologists, historians and social psychologists from Switzerland, Western Europe and North America to discuss these questions. For more information, contact Marc Helbling at: <helbling@pwi.uzh.ch>.

There will be a special workshiop on "Race, Ethnicity, Indigenous Peoples and Politics: Land, Territoriality & the Environment" during the next annual meeting of the Canadian Political Science Association, to be held between June 1-3 2010 at Concordia University in Montreal. Inspired by the 20th anniversary of the Oka Crisis, this daylong workshop will explore issues of land, territoriality and the environment from the perspective of research on race, ethnicity and Indigenous peoples. This workshop aims to bring together scholars from different subfields and participants from government, the public sector and the community and to encourage innovative, crosscutting scholarly exchange on matters of land, territoriality and environment. Paper proposals for this workshop are most welcome! Beyond the usual call for papers, REIPP is specifically seeking proposals connecting the study of race, ethnicity and Indigenous peoples and advancing the discipline and its theoretical and methodological underpinnings. For more information, visit the CPSA website at: <http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca>.

The CITSEE project (The Europeanisation of Citizenship in the Successor States of the Former Yugoslavia) is organising a conference on "Theories and Practices of Citizenship in the New Balkan States" on June 24-25, 2010 at the University of Edinburgh. The principal goal of the conference is to bring together the leading experts in the field to present comparative studies related to the general theme of citizenship in the new Balkan states (i.e. new states that emerged in South East Europe after the break-up of Yugoslavia in 1991). We seek contributions tackling theoretical issues related to citizenship in the former Yugoslavia and its successor states, actual and historical practices of citizenship in the region--ranging from inter-war Yugoslavia, socialist Yugoslavia to Yugoslavia's break-up and formation of the new states throughout the 1990s and the 2000s--Europeanisation of the citizenship policies in the region and the general impact of the EU integration perspective, as well as less-researched areas such as the relationship between citizenship and gender, social movements, education, urbanism, civil society, culture, literature, film etc. Please send an abstract (max. 500 words) as well as a short bio note by 15 November 2009 to <citsee@ed.ac.uk>. For further information, please visit our website at: <http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/citsee/>.

The Twenty-Seventh International Social Philosophy Conference sponsored by the North American Society for Social Philosophy (NASSP), will take place from July15 to July 17, 2010, at Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada.

The 10th International Conference on Diversity in Organisations, Communities and Nations will be held at Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland on 19-21 July 2010\. The Diversity Conference has a history of bringing together scholarly, government and practice-based participants with an interest in the issues of diversity and community. The Conference examines the concept of diversity as a positive aspect of a globalised society that can be promoted without engendering its alternatives: racism, conflict, discrimination and inequity. Diversity as a mode of social existence can be projected in ways that deepen the range of human experience. The Conference will seek to explore the full range of what diversity means and explore modes of diversity in real-life situations of living together in community. Full details of the Conference, including an online proposal submission form, are to be found at the Conference website: <http://www.Diversity-Conference.com/>.

The fourth annual workshop of the Centre for International and Public Law at the Australian National University will focus on "Connecting International and Public Law, Allegiance and Identity in a Globalised World", to be held at the ANU in Canberra on July 19th-21st 2010\. This workshop focuses on the impact of the movement of people on the concepts of allegiance and identity within a globalised world and its impact on law and policy at the domestic and international levels. The intention of the workshop is to explore how law, philosophy, psychology and other disciplines engage with the concepts of allegiance and identity so that the engagement can enrich public and international law's frameworks for categorising membership, in the context of the large-scale movement of people throughout the globe. The deadline to submit an abstract (of between 200-500 words maximum) for a paper addressing any of the issues raised by the topic of the workshop is 12 March 2010\. For more information, please see: <http://law.anu.edu.au/CIPL/2010_Workshop/Call_for_Papers.pdf>.

The Twelfth International Conference of the International Academy of Linguistic Law, in cooperation with the University of the Free State in Bloemfontein (South Africa), will be held from October 31st to November 4th, 2010 on the theme of "Law, Languages and Multilingual States", at the Black Mountain Hotel, in South Africa. Proposals for papers on the above mentioned theme must be received by December 15th, 2009 and may be sent by email to dplesslt.hum@ufs.ac.za.

JLCR welcomes the submission of manuscripts that meet the general criteria of significance and scientific excellence, and will publish: Original articles in basic and applied research, case studies, critical reviews, surveys, opinions, commentaries and essays. We invite you to submit your manuscript(s) to <jlcr@acadjourn.org> for publication in the monthly issue. Our objective is to inform authors of the decision on their manuscript(s) within four weeks of submission. Following acceptance, a paper will normally be published in the next issue. Instruction for authors and other details are available on our website; <http://www.academicjournals.org/JLCR/Instruction.htm>. JLCR is an Open Access Journal.

The journal Diversity is organizing a special issue on "Ethnic Diversity and Cultural Pluralism" ( <http://www.mdpi.com/journal/diversity/>), guest-edited by Dr. Lionel Obadia. This issue aims to bring together a collection of research papers or conceptual essays exploring the vast array of theoretical and methodological questions regarding the relationship between "cultural pluralism" and "ethnic diversity". Issues include political programs aiming at either the recognition or the overlooking of human differences, national or regional perspectives on the characterization of the "ethnic", qualitative and quantitative approaches towards diversity (techniques, limits, prospects), and the strategic aspects beneath ethnicity labels and/or claims. The call for papers for this special issue can be found at: <http://www.mdpi.com/journal/diversity/special_issues/ethnic-diversity/>. The deadline for manuscript submissions is 31 March 2010.

The new Journal of Internal Displacement has announced a call for papers for its inaugural volume on the topic of "Internal Displacement: Definitions, Scope, Theories and Concepts". The term "Internally Displaced People" (IDPs), unlike "Refugee", is relatively new but has become the central focus of scholarly and non-scholarly debates around the globe. Questions include (1) who should be included in the definition of internal displacement, (2) whether Internal Displacement Law should be enacted, and (3) whose responsibility it is to protect IDPs. Academics, civil society groups, humanitarian agencies, refugee practitioners, lawyers and policy makers have created numerous camps, each defining and understanding the concept from their disciplines.

UNESCO has just released its World Report on Cultural Diversity. This newest World Report is focused on cultural diversity as a source of renewal for public policies relating to development, social cohesion and peace. Based on the analysis of recent initiatives, concrete examples, case studies and successful practices, the World Report aims to address the manifold aspects of cultural diversity, critically review common notions and assumptions, and propose policy-oriented recommendations on topics as diverse as identities and dialogue, the future of languages and intercultural education, media pluralism and cultural industries, the business world, local knowledge, biodiversity, sustainable development, governance and human rights. While the promotion of cultural diversity has taken on increasing visibility on the international scene, it often continues to be perceived as a threat to the cohesion of increasingly diversified societies. Hence, the need to elucidate the conditions under which cultural diversity can constitute a positive contribution to development and peace. The World Report is available on line at: <http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001852/185202E.pdf>.

The EDUMIGROM project ("Ethnic differences in education and diverging prospects for urban youth in an enlarged Europe"), launched in March 2008, has now produced two sets of country reports on education and on ethnic relations. The 16 background reports provide contextual background and present detailed information on a wide spectrum of policies and policy outcomes that relate to the inclusion of minority ethnic youth as well as to segregation and forms of discrimination (in short, the lack or failures of policies of inclusion). The reports have been uploaded on the project website: <http://www.edumigrom.eu/publications/>. Based on the background reports, cross-country teams have produced three comparative reports on Education, Ethnic Relations, and Education Policies for Inclusion. These reports sum up experiences on educational systems and ethnic relations shaping the space for education for multiethnic/diverse communities in old and new member states of the EU. These papers have also been posted on the project website.<http://www.edumigrom.eu>

The international Cities of Migration project (<http://www.citiesofmigration.ca>) seeks to improve local integration practice in major immigrant receiving cities worldwide through information sharing and learning exchange. The Cities of Migration website is anchored by a collection of "Good Ideas in Integration." These profiles showcase good city-level integration practices that provide innovative and practical solutions to common problems and challenges. Under the themes of Work, Live, Learn, Connect and Plan, users will discover Good Ideas in the integration of urban migrants that can be adapted locally or inspire new thinking in this important dimension of city prosperity and growth.

The European Democracy Observatory on Citizenship (EUDO CITIZENSHIP) is a new project that provides comprehensive analyses and data on citizenship laws and policies in all EU member states and six neighbouring countries. It is headquartered at the European University Institute, directed by Rainer Baubock. In Europe, each country follows its own rules in determining who its citizens are. However, the nationals of member states of the European Union are also EU citizens who enjoy rights of free movement and political participation throughout the Union. The EUDO CITIZENSHIP observatory compares the ways in which citizenship can be acquired and lost and documents policy trends such as the growing toleration of dual citizenship, the introduction of naturalisation tests, or the number of countries in which citizenship can be acquired through birth in the territory. The observatory features expert reports on the history and current regulation of citizenship in each country, searchable databases on nationality laws and international legal norms, a comprehensive bibliography, a forum for debates, a selection of news from the media and other useful tools and information for policy makers, NGOs and academics with an interest in citizenship policies. The project is funded by the European Commission's European Fund for the Integration of Third Country Nationals. The project website is: at: <http://eudo-citizenship.eu>.

The Club de Madrid, an international association of former heads of state, has released a set of documents regarding its "Shared Societies Project", which aims at "building a world safe for difference".
