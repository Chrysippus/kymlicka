#### 1\. Introduction

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year, research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a quarterly newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the eleventh issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or various non-governmental organizations.

If you know anyone who would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, or if you would like copies of the back-issues, please contact us at <cded@post.queensu.ca>. For further information about the research project, you can also reach us by fax at 613-545-6545.

#### 2\. Upcoming Conferences

The 15th Annual International Social Philosophy conference was held on August 7-9 1998, at the Massachussets College of Liberal Arts, on the topic of "World Community and Cultural Integrity: Individual and Group Rights in a Global Context". The keynote speaker was Carol Gould. More information is available at: <http://www.pitt.edu/~nassp/>

The Swiss Ethnological Association is devoting its annual conference to the topic of "Individual and collective rights: perspectives from the anthropology of law" on Oct. 15-17, 1998 at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland. Conference themes include models of citizenship, communitarianism and constitutional patriotism, minorities and new social movements, multination and multiculture.

The High Commissioner for National Minorities of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is organizing a conference on "Governance and Participation: Integrating Diversity", in Locarno, Switzerland October 18-20 1998\. The conference will explore ways and means to integrate diversity through effective participation in public decision-making processes, including through decentralisation and subsidiarity. While this is of general interest in all democratic societies, it has special significance for persons belonging to national minorities whose special needs may be largely addressed through various forms of governance and participation. The conference will examine this issue both in general, and in the specific context of education. For more information, contact Stefan Vassilev, fax: 31-703635910; email: <hcnm@hcnm.org>

The Centre publishes a journal entitled "European Journal of International Migration and Ethnic Relations", and organizes the EUROFOR conferences (see under "conferences" above).

<http://www.ciral.ulaval.ca/alx/amlxmonde/accmonde.htm> This website includes detailed information in French about language policy around the world, with information organized by country, language, and type of linguistic policy. It is part of the "Centre Internationale de Recherche en Amenagement Linguistique" (CIRAL) at Laval University.

<http://www.netcom.com/~ethnic/per.html> This is the website for the Princeton-based "Project on Ethnic Relations" (PER), founded in 1991 in anticipation of the serious inter-ethnic conflicts in the post-communist world. PER conducts programs of intervention and dialogue, and mediates in several disputes in the region. It also conducts programs of training, education and research at international, national and community levels. The website contains many interesting reports on particular countries or regions (eg., the Balkans, Slovakia, Romania), groups (eg., the Roma) or more general topics (eg., the role of the media; East-West relations), as well as back-issues of the PER bulletin.

<http://users.skynet.be/suffrage-universel> This website, developed by Pierre-Yves Lambert, contains a miscellaneous array of information (mostly in French, with some in English) about the relations between democracy and ethnicity in many different countries, primarily in Europe, North America and Africa, including election data, scholarly articles, and bibliographical references. It also includes back-issues of "suffrage-universel", a newsletter in French about relations between citizens, democracy, ethnicity and nationality.

<http://www.aaf.gov.bc.ca/aaf/treaty/nisgaa/docs/nisga_agreement.html> This website contains the final text of the very important (and controversial) treaty signed in Canada on August 4 1998 with the Nisga'a, one of the Aboriginal peoples in British Columbia. It may set the pattern for many more outstanding land claims and self-government agreements with Canada's Aboriginal peoples.

The Commission on Immigration Reform in the United States released a report in 1997, on _Becoming an American_, calling for increased emphasis on the "Americanization" of immigrants. In the fall of 1997, the Terry Stanford Institute of Public Policy at Duke University organized a "Workshop on Immigration and Citizenship" to analyse this report. Participants included Anthony Appiah, David Hollinger, Linda Bosniak, Noah Pickus, Joseph Carens, Peter Shuck, Michael Jones-Correa, John Miller, Alexander Aleinikoff, Rogers Smith and many others. An interesting Final Report on the Workshop has recently been released, entitled "Becoming American/America Belonging". It discusses issues such as Americanization, naturalization, dual citizenship, loyalty oaths, and multiculturalism. For copies of the report, write to Duke Workshop on Immigration and Citizenship, Box 90245, Duke University, Durham NC, 27708-0245\. Copies of the report are also available on the Web at: <http://www.pubpol.duke.edu/people/faculty/pickus/immigration>

The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington is organizing a "Comparative Citizenship Project" to explore and compare citizenship issues in various parts of the world. The first stage of the project involves commissioning case studies from countries around the world, to help identify the sorts of issues raised by citizenship policy. Future stages of the project will attempt to develop comparisons between the various countries, and to identify some common themes (eg., citizenship and gender; immigrants and national minorities; citizenship and integration strategies; citizenship and welfare states). A major conference was held in May 1998 to discuss the case-study papers from the first stage of the project. Participants included Joseph Carens, Rainer Baubock, Miriam Feldblum, Alexander Aleinikoff, Christian Joppke, Patrick Weil, Ayelet Shachar, Donald Galloway, David Martin, Marco Martinello, Ari Zolberg and others. A detailed report on the conference is posted on the Web at: <http://www.ceip.org/programs/migrat/migconfcil.htm>

A major new research project has been undertaken on citizenship education in Canada, bringing together academics and policy-makers, under the coordination of Prof. Yvonne Hebert of the University of Calgary. Four "themes" have been identified for systematic research: citizenship conceptions; citizenship practices; citizenship values; and citizenship skills, knowledge, attitudes and behaviour. For each theme, several specific research projects have been identified. For more information, a report on the project has been posted on the Metroplis web-site: <http://canada.metropolis.globalx.net/Heritage/Kanan/summary.html>

An email-based forum has been started recently on theories and practices of multiculturalism, primarily in the Israeli context. The listserv, called "Culture-L: multiculturalism in Israel", discusses papers, recent events, announcements, and is intended to discuss practical issues from a theoretical perspective. For more information, to to join the forum, contact the list moderator, Hagai Agmon-Smir, at the School for Educational Leadership, by email at: <hagai@sel.org.il>
