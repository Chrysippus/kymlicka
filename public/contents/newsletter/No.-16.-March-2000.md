#### 1\. Introduction

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year, research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a quarterly newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the sixteenth issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or various non-governmental organizations.

If you know anyone who would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, or if you would like copies of the back-issues, please contact us at <cded@post.queensu.ca>. For further information about the research project, you can also reach us by fax at 613-533-6545\. Back-issues of the newsletter are posted at the end of this page.

The Carnegie Corporation of New York has started a new grantmaking initiative on "The Contending Norms of Self-Determination and the Sanctity of Existing International Boundaries". How can we address the age-old problem of reconciling attempts by the state to preserve the sanctity of its territorial borders and its sovereign authority within them with the desire of constituent national groups to assert their particular claims for self-determination? Old models for resolving this dilemma face new challenges, including destabilizing demographic shifts, evolving notions of sovereignty and revolutionary technological change. The Corporation is particularly interested in proposals which extend the reach of existing scholarship or advance new approaches to addressing ongoing or emerging self-determination struggles. Relevant topics include internal political structures, the implications of globalization, and external intervention. For more information, including deadlines for submitting proposals, contact Stephen Del Rosso, Senior Program Officer, International Peace and Security Program, Carnegie Corporation of New York, 437 Madison Avenue, New York NY 10022\.

Greek Helsinki Monitor, in cooperation with Minority Rights Group-Greece, has launched a project on Human and Minority Rights in Southeast Europe. This is part of the larger framework of the Centre for Documentation and Information of Minorities in Europe (CEDIME). CEDIME aims to contribute, through the commitment of researchers and intellectuals, to the peaceful resolution of the problems and conflicts, which often characterize relations between minorities and majorities. Its purpose is to create the first comprehensive source of information on human and minority rights in Southeast Europe. The project aims to provide three types of information: (1) presentation of all ethnonational, ethnolinguistic, and religious minorities in Southeast Europe; (2) guide to all documents on human and minority rights in Southeast Europe; (3) reports from daily monitoring of the major print media in each country on neighbouring countries, peoples, and minorities within each country. The site of the CEDIME project is expected to be a major reference source for policy makers, activists, journalists, and researchers. For further information on the CEDIME-SE project, contact Panayote Elias Dimitras, Director of CEDIME, P.O. Box 51 393, GR-14510 Kifisia, Greece; tel: 30-4-62-0120; fax: 30-1-807-5767; e-mail: <panayote@greekhelsinki.gr> or visit the CEDIME and Balkan Human Rights Web Pages (BHRWP) joint web site: <http://www.greekhelsinki.gr>

Two new master's degrees have recently been established that may be of interest:

(1) A new master's degree program has been established in Budapest, called the "European Master on Minority Rights". This initiative, sponsored by the Council of Europe, reflects the increasing need to prepare experts and teachers on Minority Rights for international organizations, universities, government departments and NGOs. The one-year curriculum provides an interdisciplinary setting for both classical topics on minorities and newly emerging issues. Graduates receive a degree from the Robert Schumann University.
