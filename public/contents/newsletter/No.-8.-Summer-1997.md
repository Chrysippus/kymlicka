#### 5\. Journals

Have you written a paper on issues of citizenship and ethnocultural diversity, but don't know where to publish it? In previous issues of this newsletter, we've listed several new journals on topics of ethnicity and nationalism, or on cultural studies more generally. For those with a more normative or philosophical approach, there have also been some interesting new journals in the field of political philosophy, many of which publish papers in the area of democracy and pluralism. These include the Journal of Political Philosophy; Public Affairs Quarterly, Ethics and International Affairs; Constellations; The Responsive Community; Canadian Journal of Law and Jurisprudence; Social Identities. For a helpful survey of these new journals, see David McCabe's "New Journals in Political Philosophy and Related Fields", Ethics, Vol. 106/4 (1996), pp. 800 16\. For more law oriented papers, you might consider two recent journals. The Michigan Journal of Race and Law was founded in 1995 to serve as a forum for the exploration of issues relating to race and law. To submit a paper, send it to the Article Editors, Michigan Journal of Race and Law, University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor MA, 48109 1215\. Fax: 313 764 6043\. For more information about the journal, and for a list of other race related law journals, see the MJRL web page at: <http://www.law.umich.edu/pubs/journals/mjrl/>

The former International Journal on Group Rights, formed in 1993, has just been renamed as the International Journal on Group and Minority Rights. It is published by Kluwer, and edited by Yonah Alexander of George Washington University in Washington DC. It is "devoted to legal, political, and social problems stemming from the existence of minorities and groups within society", focusing specifically on groups defined by religion, race, culture and language. For more information, see the Kluwer web page at <http://kapis.www.wkap.nl/> (then click on "journal homepages").

#### 6\. Internet Resources

(a) Human Rights: One of the most remarkable (and remarked upon) developments in the internet has been the international networking of human rights groups. There are now literally hundreds of web sites relating to human rights on the internet. Here are just a few of the most interesting ones:

- <http://shr.aaas.org/dhr.htm> <http://www.umn.edu/humanrts> These are two useful directories to human rights resources on the web. The first is the "Directory of Human Rights Resources on the Internet", developed by the Amercian Association for the Advancement of Science. It contains descriptions and links to hundreds of sites organized by topic, region, and language, as well as an index of electronic publications available on the internet, and a list of upcoming events. The second is the "University of Minnesota Human Rights Library", which is another comprehensive list of relevant sites.
- <http://www.amnesty.org> <http://www.state.gov/www/global/human_rights/1996_hrp_report/> These two sites provide helpful overviews of the state of human rights around the world. The first is the web page for Amnesty International, and includes their country by country survey of human rights abuses. The second is the annual human rights "country reports" compiled by the U.S. Department of State.
- <http://www.uottawa.ca/~hrrec/> For human rights resources in Canada, check out the web site of the Human Rights Research and Education Center (HRREC) at the University of Ottawa. It contains information about human rights organizations in Canada, as well as upcoming conferences and workshops, the Centre's publications (including its Bulletin), and extensive links to other sites in Canada and abroad.
- <http://www.cdnreporter.ca> This is the web site for the Canadian Human Rights Reporter. The CHRR is a non profit publisher intended to promote access to human rights law in Canada. The web site contains excerpts from most of the important human rights cases in Canada, as well as links to related sites.

(b) Ethnicity/Nationalism Research Resources

- <http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/ethnic.htm> Fred Riggs at the University of Hawaii coordinates ETHNIC L, a discussion list of liason persons for a global set of organizer groups, associations, centers, and related organizations interested in promoting research on ethnicity. Members share information through an e mail list. This web site contains a list of the associated groups, with links to their internet sites and e mail addresses.
- <http://kennedy.soc.surrey.ac.uk/socresonline/2/1/natlinks.html> The Dutch political scientist Paul Treanor has created an extensive, and often humorous, collection of links to resources on nationalism and ethnicity. It includes an idiosyncratic collection of academic research, government documents, popular press articles, NGOs, political party programs, all organized according to Treanor's own typology of forms of nationalism (globalism, macro cultural, national state nationalism, ethno nationalism, and localism). This is part of the "Sociological Research Online" series.
- <http://www.ercomer.org/wwwvl/> This the new internet address for the superb ERCOMER "Virtual Library on Migration and Ethnic Relations", which we mentioned in newsletter #6\. Also a new search engine has been added to the site, so that you can now search the over 1,500 electronic documents by keyword. The first place to look for anyone wanting to get a sense of the resources available on the internet on ethnic relations.

(c) Miscellaneous

- <http://www.partal.com/ciemen/conf/> This is the website for the "Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights", sponsored by PEN and the EscarrQ International Centre for Ethnic Minorities and Nations (CEIMEN). It is the result of a two year process of drafting, involving twelve successive versions, and the participation of over fifty international experts and 100 NGOs from ninety nations. The final draft was approved at a conference in Barcelona in June 1996\. The sponsors hope that it will lead to the adoption of an International Convention on language rights by the United Nations.
- <http://www.osceprag.cz/inst/hcnm/hcnm1.htm> This is the web site of the Office of the High Commissioner on National Minorities (HCNM), which was created in 1992 by the Organization for Security and Co operation in Europe. The High Commissioner (Max van der Stoel) has been involved in some of the most interesting and controversial political developments relating to the rights of national minorities in Europe over the last few years. This web site includes information about the mandate and activities of the HCNM, and instructions about how to receive bulletins regarding the High Commissioner's work. The HCNM is assisted in this work by the Foundation on Inter Ethnic Relations (FIER) in The Hague, under the direction of Arie Bloed. FIER engages in analytical research to promote understanding of minority issues. For information about FIER, contact <FIER@Euronet.nl>. ; fax: 31 70 3465213

#### 7\. Related Research Programs

A two volume Encyclopedia of Minorities in American Politics is beingpublished by Oryx Press. It will contain over 2000 free standing entrieson people, events, ideas as well as susbtantial essays on currentpolitical issues. The editors are seeking people to write entries. If youare interested, please contact the Series Editor, Jeff Schultz, at<schultzj@kear.tds.net>. Or by fax at 603 526 4954.

UNESCO designed and sponsors an extensive program called "MOST" to promote international comparative social science research on areas of vital human importance. One of the largest research themes within the MOST program is "Multicultural and Multiethnic Societies", which aims to promote research "on the nature of change in multicultural and multiethnic societies in which issues of education, culture and religion, identity and human needs, democratic governance, conflict and cohesion interact". It primarily supports large scale long term research, and seeks to transfer the relevant findings to decision makers, and thereby establish sustainable links between the scientific and policy communities. Specific projects include studies of ethnic conflict in Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific migration, and ethnicity in Africa. For more information on these projects, see the MOST web site, listed below. This site also includes the full texts of several interesting discussion papers on the methodological issues and policy options relevant to research on multiculturalism, written by Henri Giordan, Stephen Castles, Juan Diez Medrano, Christine Inglis and others. You can also ask to be sent e mail updates on MOST projects, or sign up for the MOST "Discussion Forum on Ethnic Policy". The web site is: <http://www.unesco.org/most/restheme.htm>.
