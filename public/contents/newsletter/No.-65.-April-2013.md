There will a conference on "Muslims, Multiculturalism and Trust: New Directions" to be held on 1-2 June 2013 at SOAS, University of London. Recent high-profile interventions by politicians in the West declaring the 'failure' of multiculturalism have had, as their very thinly disguised context, mistrust in those Muslim communities that have been growing in Western Europe and the United States since the end of the colonial era. The sense that multiculturalism has been a flawed experiment, that 'unintegrated' Muslims are evidence of this, has become a truism of much journalism and media coverage too. This conference brings together leading experts from across the social science/humanities divide to examine the intersections and tensions between different approaches to questions of multiculturalism and trust, and to explore the possibility of developing mutually informative interdisciplinary approaches to shed new light on this topic. The aim of the conference is to analyse current critiques of multiculturalism, measure them against other, perhaps more progressive interpretations, and consider the potential offered by lived experience and creative visions of intercultural exchange to offer new ways of envisaging multicultural experience. Invited participants include: Rehana Ahmed, Claire Chambers, Sohail Daulatzai, Rumy Hasan, Salah Hassan, Tony Laden, Alana Lentin, Nasar Meer, Tariq Modood, Anshuman Mondal, Peter Morey, Stephen Morton, Jorgen Nielsen, Lord Bhikhu Parekh, Amina Yaqin. This is one of a series of events in the larger research project on Muslims, Trust and Cultural Dialogue, analysing the conditions of trust and mistrust in three overlapping areas of modern life: politics and society; business and finance; and art and culture. It is an international multidisciplinary network of scholars, practitioners and stakeholders exploring questions of trust in the relationship between Muslim diaspora populations in the West and the societies around them.

The final report of the "Taking Part: Muslim Participation in Contemporary Governance" project has now been released, and is available for download. The report provides the main findings from the most comprehensive study to date on UK Muslim-government relations, which included an analysis of public policy since 1997, a total of 112 interviews with key policymakers and Muslim civil society actors, and in-depth local case studies of Birmingham, Leicester, and Tower Hamlets, London. The Report describes how British Muslims have been taking part in governance in the three policy fields of equality, diversity & cohesion; faith sector governance; and security. It describes how modes of Muslim representation have developed into a broader 'democratic constellation'. The project was led by Dr Therese O'Toole, Professor Tariq Modood, Dr Daniel Nilsson DeHanas and Dr Stephen Jones at Bristol University and Dr Nasar Meer of Northumbria University. <http://www.bristol.ac.uk/ethnicity/projects/muslimparticipation/output.html>.
