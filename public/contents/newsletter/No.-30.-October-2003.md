There are over 150 ethnic conflicts in the world today. All of them create instability, and some of them pose a global threat. The most intractable ethnic conflicts are the ones that lead to territorial partition. Whether they are historical, de facto or unfinished, ethnic partitions create recurrent cycles of conflict, as the ongoing conflicts in the Balkans, South Asia, and the Middle East show. Can ethnic partitions be stabilized, or is conflict inherent in their structure? This web site explores the answers to this question, from lessons learned to the options ahead. <http://www.partitionconflicts.org>

The Programme in Comparative Media Law and Policy (PCMLP), Oxford University and the Institute for Information Law (IViR) of the University of Amsterdam, have just released a new study on the regulation of minority languages in broadcasting in Europe. Entitled "Minority-Language Related Broadcasting and Legislation in the OSCE", edited by T. McGonagle, B. Davis Noll & M. Price, the study was commissioned by the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities. It is based on a comprehensive survey of the regulation of minority language use in the broadcasting sectors of each of the 55 Participating States of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). A detailed comparative overview presents the trends identified in States throughout the OSCE region against the background of existing international legal norms. Individual country reports document and contextualise formal prescriptions and proscriptions of language and other measures affecting the use of minority languages. The study is now available online at <http://www.ivir.nl/index-english.html>.
