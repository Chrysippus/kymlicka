#### 1\. Introduction

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year, research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a quarterly newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the forty-forth issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or non-governmental organizations.

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a workshop on "Deliberative Politics and Institutional Design in Multicultural Democracies" at Queen's on May 4-5, 2007\. The workshop is part of a project to explore the linkages between contemporary debates on the theory and practice of deliberative democracy and debates on the theory and practice of multicultural citizenship. How do institutional reforms intended to enhance deliberative democracy affect issues of multiculturalism, and vice versa? Participants include Ian O'Flynn, Henry Milner, Donna Lee Van Cott, Gianpaolo Baiocchi, Phil Oxhorn, Clarissa Hayward, Loren King, Genevieve Fuji Johnson, Monique Deveaux, David Kahane, Dan Munro, and Jacob Levy.

The Institute for Advanced Studies at Tel Aviv University is organizing a five-day workshop on citizenship in wartime, to take place December 27-31, 2007, in Tel Aviv. The workshop will explore the theoretical and practical implications of war and terror situations for the institution of citizenship in democratic states. Citizenship, as a concept and an institution, is a keystone of Western democratic society, in war and peace. But in wartimes, including low-intensity wars, democratic societies face different challenges than the ones facing them during peace, in areas such as human rights, the status of minorities, immigration, the state's obligations to its citizens, and the meaning of social solidarity. Scholars in the fields of philosophy, political science, sociology, history, law, labor studies and related disciplines, who are interested in the workshop, should email a 250-word abstract of a research paper to Prof. Noah Lewin-Epstein, Dean, The Gershon Gordon Faculty of Social Science, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel, noah1@post.tau.ac.il, by May 15, 2007\.

#### 5\. Call for Papers

A call for papers has been issued for a forthcoming issue of UNESCO's International Journal on Multicultural Studies (IJMS), entitled "Citizenship Tests in a Post-National Era". Edited by Sue Wright and Matthias Koenig, the issue will focus on citizenship tests as an aspect of integration in industrial countries of immigration. Such tests have emerged in a variety of countries, and are often interpreted as evidence that multiculturalism has been superseded by a turn to assimilation. This issue will scrutinize these new developments. Proposals on the following topics are especially welcome: public debates over citizenship tests in different states, overviews of geographical areas or groups of comparable states, test content, accessibility and acceptability of content, tests as new forms of nation building, tests as a form of gate-keeping, and testing as a step towards greater fairness and transparency. For more details, contact the editors by email at: Sue.Wright@port.ac.uk or Matthias.Koenig@sowi.uni-goettingen.de Information on this special issue is also found on the IJMS website: <http://www.unesco.org/shs/ijms>

A call for contributions has been issued for a forthcoming collection entitled; "Multiculturalism: The Great Marketing Strategy? An International Perspective", to be edited by Reza Hasmath, University of Cambridge. The collection will examine multiculturalism in various international contexts, from both political/philosophical and public policy standpoints. The aim is to investigate how multiculturalism is understood and implemented, and to analyze the outcomes of multiculturalism policies. Contributors are invited to explore the following general themes: political/philosophical arguments for multiculturalism, feasibility of multiculturalism in multi-ethnic contexts, outcomes of multiculturalism, linkages between multiculturalism and political philosophy/public policy, comparisons between different multicultural realities, and the future of multiculturalism. Contributors are encouraged to consider whether multiculturalism is simply a marketing strategy or a coherent normative strategy for dealing with the demands of local ethnic populations. Accepted contributions (7000 w) should be complete by December 15, 2007, with a publication schedule for spring 2008\. To contribute, send an abstract of 500w or less with a short professional brief (150w) prior to June 30, 2007 to Reza Hasmath: rh376@cam.ac.uk

#### 7\. RELATED PROGRAMS, PROJECTS AND FELLOWSHIPS

The University of Pennsylvania has established a new program on "Democracy, Citizenship, and Constitutionalism" (DCC). This program is an interdisciplinary initiative, funded by the Mellon Foundation, which includes a faculty seminar series and annual conference on themes chosen by the Program's Faculty Advisory Council; a graduate workshop series; a postdoctoral fellowship, and undergraduate research grants. In its first year, the Program's 2007-2008 theme will be "Citizenship, Borders, and Human Needs." For more information, including information on applying for the postdoctoral fellowship, see the School of Arts and Sciences website [<http://www.sas.upenn.edu/deans-office/DCCApplicationGuidelines>] or contact DCC Program Chair Rogers M. Smith, Christopher H. Browne Distinguished Professor of Political Science, rogerss@sas.upenn.edu

A new project on "Diversity and the European Public Sphere: Towards a Citizens' Europe" has recently been launched, funded under the EU's 6th Framework Programme. The project, also called "EUROSPHERE", will last for five years, and involves an international consortium of 17 European universities/research institutes, with approximately 150 researchers working. Initiated and coordinated by Yngve G. Lithman and Hakan G. Sicakkan at the University of Bergen, Norway, EUROSPHERE will organize four major conferences, European forums, researcher training courses, and PhD courses examining issues of diversity within Europe and its impact on the construction of a common European public sphere. Activities will be announced regularly on the EUROSPHERE website: <http://eurosphere.uib.no>.

A research project known as "Testing Regimes" has been established at Soton University to examine the various ways that European countries are dealing with the role of language in the integration of immigrants, and in particular the growing emphasis on the promotion and testing of knowledge of the `national language'. One of the most pressing issues in contemporary European societies is the need to promote integration and social inclusion in the context of rapidly increasing migration. A particular challenge confronting national governments is the need to accommodate speakers of an ever increasing number of languages within what in most cases are still perceived as historically monolingual societies. This has given rise to public debates in many countries on proposals to impose a requirement of competence in a 'national' language and culture as a condition for acquiring citizenship. This project brings together international experts on language policy to exchange knowledge and ideas on this question in order to develop a more well-informed basis for public discussion and policy formulation. See the projects website as: <http://www.testingregimes.soton.ac.uk/about.html>
