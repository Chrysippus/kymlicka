#### 1\. Introduction

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year, research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a quarterly newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the thirty-second issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or non-governmental organizations.

If you would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, please contact us at cded@post.queensu.ca. Back-issues of the newsletter are posted on the Web on Will Kymlicka's home-page: <http://qsilver.queensu.ca/~philform/newsletter.html>

A special section entitled "Engagements: Borders \& Immigration" is included in a recent issue of the journal ACME: An International Journal for Critical Cartographers (Vol. 2, Issue 2, 2003).
