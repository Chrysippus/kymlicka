#### 1\. Introduction

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the sixty-eighth issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or non-governmental organizations.

If you would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, please contact us at <cded@queensu.ca>. Back-issues of the newsletter are posted on the Web on Will Kymlicka's home-page: <http://post.queensu.ca/~kymlicka/ddnewsletter.php>

#### 2\. Upcoming Conferences

A workshop on "The Strains of Commitment: The Political Sources of Solidarity in Diverse Societies" will be held at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy on February 20-21, 2014\. What sustains solidarity in ethnically and religiously diverse societies? While considerable research has been devoted to analysing the economic factors (eg., perceptions of economic threat) and social factors (eg., levels of interpersonal contact) that affect social cohesion, less attention has been paid to the broader political context. This workshop will focus on the impact of different conceptions of political community, different models of the welfare state, different policies toward diversity, different patterns of political participation, and the sharing (or contesting) of political values. The workshop is organized by Keith Banting and Will Kymlicka, and supported by RECODE (Responding to Complex Diversity in Europe and Canada), a research network sponsored by the European Science Foundation, the Global Governance Programme of the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies at the European University Institute, and by Queen's University in Kingston, Canada. For more information, contact the organizers (<keith.banting@queensu.ca>; <kymlicka@queensu.ca>)

The Foster Europe Foundation, in cooperation with the Institute for Studies on Federalism and Regionalism, European Academy of Bolzano, the Institut d' Estudis Autonòmics (IEA), Barcelona and the Academy of Government, University of Edinburgh, is organizing an international conference on "Qualified Autonomy and Federalism versus Secession in the EU and its Member States" on February 26-28, 2014 at the Esterházy Palace in Eisenstadt, Austria. The conference explores not only autonomist and secessionist movements within EU member-states (particularly in Spain, UK and Belgium), but also the ways in which member states are seeking greater autonomy and perhaps even secession from the EU.

A two-day conference on "Citizenship after Orientalism" will take place on March 6–7, 2014, at the Open University Main Campus in Milton Keynes (UK). This is the final conference of the "Citizenship after Orientalism" (Oecumene) project funded by the European Research Council (ERC).

The Community of Philosophical Thinkers, in collaboration with the Philosophy Department at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, is hosting its 6th Annual Student Philosophy Conference on April 12, 2014 on the theme "An Undergraduate Colloquium on Race". Undergraduate students are invited to submit papers and presentations that explore race and race theory. Charles W. Mills will deliver the keynote address. Submissions should be sent electronically to the following address: <coptconference@uncc.edu> prior to February 15th. Questions about the conference and/or submission requirements should be forwarded via email to David C. Rojas (<drojas3@uncc.edu>).

The 2nd Annual University of Toronto Centre for Ethics Graduate Student Conference will take place on April 25-26, 2014\. Much recent work in ethics, political theory and philosophy has questioned the scope and boundaries of our moral and political communities and new frontiers are emerging in the work of gender, queer and disability theorists. These developments are challenging entrenched understandings of what it means to be human, and some theorists have proposed that we should move 'beyond humanism'; a suitable moral and political theory should consider non-human animals, environmental concerns, and human relations with modern technology. This year's keynote speakers, Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka, will discuss their recent book Zoopolis. For information on this conference, contact the event organizers via email: <graduateassociates@gmail.com>

For its 25th anniversary, the Cultural, Social and Political Thought program at the University of Victoria is hosting a conference on "Thinking as a Way of Life" on April 26-27, 2014\. What modes of thinking are required or made possible in relation to new forms of capitalism, colonialism, biopolitics, heteronormativity, indigeneity, and technology? In what ways can inter- and multi-disciplinary research adequately address these shifting landscapes, especially when such work is, despite its efforts, often subject to those governing structures and disciplinary mechanisms that it seeks to destabilize? The Conference will contrast traditional notions of thinking as a practice of abstract contemplation and suggest that thinking is always an intervention into the social field, within which it is necessarily embedded. Expressions of interest should be sent via email to: thinkingwayoflife@gmail.com prior to February 15th. For more information, visit: <http://www.ipsa.org/news/call-for-paper/thinking-way-life-graduate-conference-cultural-social-and-political-thought>

The Centre for ethnic and migration studies (CEDEM), the Centre for studies of public opinion (CLEO) and the Centre for development Studies (Pôle Sud) of the University of Liège are pleased to announce the TRICUD Final International Conference on "Transnationalism, Identity Dynamics and Cultural Diversification in Urban Post-migratory Situations". It will take place on 14-16 May 2014 at the Université de Liège, Belgium. The TRICUD programme (2010-2014) is a multidisciplinary research programme which aims at better understanding how migration transforms both sending societies in the South and receiving societies in the North. Migration has also prompted the formation of transnational social spaces connecting home and destination countries. This phenomenon has been observable between Belgium and the Democratic Republic of Congo and Morocco - two key case-studies. The TRICUD Final Conference aims at presenting the main findings of the programme and to open the discussion on its 3 main axes: the post-migratory cities and transnational flows, the dynamics of identities and the process of cultural diversification. Keynote speakers are Steve Vertovec (Max Planck Institute) and Nina Glick-Schiller (University of Manchester). For more information, and to register, contact <Sonia.Gsir@ulg.ac.be>

The University of Edinburgh's Ethnicity, Nationalism and National Identity Network (ENNIN) will be hosting a one-day graduate conference entitled 'Identity, Nations and Nationalism in a Changing World'.

Our aim is to provide an opportunity for Ph.D. students and professors to exchange ideas and build networks in a welcoming setting that encourages interdisciplinary dialogue and approaches. There will be five different panels: Accommodating Plural Societies: Pathways to Autonomy and Independence; Gender and Nationalism; Socialism, Class and Nationalism; Spreading Nationalism: Media and Literature; and Migration and Diversity. The conference keynote speech will be delivered by John Breuilly. There will also be a timely roundtable on Scotland's constitutional future with David McCrone, Michael Keating and Michael Rosie.

A conference on "Social Equality" is being organized by the Department of Philosophy at the University of Cape Town (South Africa), from August 15-17, 2014\. Contemporary societies are strikingly unequal and social inequality is frequently a visible aspect of daily life; but there are forms of inequality and disadvantage not immediately obvious to casual observers. It would be naive to think philosophy on its own could do anything to alleviate inequality. This event will attempt to increase our understanding of inequality in contemporary societies. Keynote speakers will include: Miranda Fricker (University of Sheffield), Charles W. Mills (Northwestern University), and Jonathan Wolff (UCL). Researchers (including postgraduate students) wishing to present papers are asked to send abstracts by email to: <SocialEqualityUCT@gmail.com> by February 18\.
