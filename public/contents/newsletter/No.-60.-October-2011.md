#### 1\. Introduction

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year, research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the sixtieth issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or non-governmental organizations.

If you would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, please contact us at <cded@queensu.ca>. Back-issues of the newsletter are posted on the Web on Will Kymlicka's home-page: <http://www.queensu.ca/cded/news.html>

#### 2\. Upcoming Conferences

An International Conference on "Bringing Migration and History into the Equation: Re-Imagining Nationhood and Belonging" will be held on 5-7 October 2011 at Jewish Museum Berlin, Germany, organized by Network Migration in Europe. The conference will address the intersection of migration, identity formation and belonging from comparative and historical perspectives. Topics include migrant inclusion and political/historical representation; (Re)formation of nationhood and identities under conditions of diversity; Writing, teaching and displaying history in immigrant societies; Social and cultural practices/strategies of institutions, organisations and communities to represent migrants and their cultures/histories; Transnational and mediated public spheres; Borders and belongings: From guest workers and refugees to post-migrants; Methodological and theoretical contributions with regard to identity formation, identity politics and historical representation of migration. The conference will be framed by the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish labor recruitment contract in October 2011\. A follow-up conference will be held in Essen in spring 2012, focussing on Lieux de memoire [places/sites of memory] of migration history.

The University of York in Toronto, Canada is hosting the "International Symposium on Identity, Civic Engagement, Multiculturalism and Transnationalism: Portuguese Canadian Immigrant Descendants in Canada" to be held on October 11-12, in Toronto, Ontario. The topics to be addressed include how Portuguese-Canadian descendants relate to the notions of being Portuguese and Canadian; factors contributing to identity negotiation; multiculturalism, sense of citizenship and civic participation; sense of belonging and civic engagement; and negotiating transnationalism. For information and registrations, visit <http://porcansymposium.eventbrite.com/>

A workshop on "Multiculturalism or Interculturalism? What are the Implications for Albertans and Canadians?" will take place between November 10-11, 2011 at the University of Calgary Faculty of Law, co-organized by the Alberta Civil Liberties Research Centre and the European Academy. Questions for discussion include: Does multiculturalism mean "anything goes"? How important is language for personal identity? What are "Canadian values" anyway? For more information contact Brian Seaman: <bseaman@ucalgary.ca>, ph: [403-220-2505](tel:403-220-2505). To register, visit [www.regonline.ca/ACLRCEURAC](http://www.regonline.ca/ACLRCEURAC)

An international symposium on "Restorative Justice, Reconciliation and Peacebuilding" will take place at New York University Law School November 11-12, 2011\. The symposium is a project of the Program on Religion and Reconciliation at the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, University of Notre Dame in collaboration with the Restorative Peacebuilding Project of the Working Party on Restorative Justice of the Alliance of NGOs on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice in New York. All over the world controversies continue to beset the practice of peacebuilding. Peace versus justice. Religious versus secular. Individual versus structural justice. Forgiveness versus retribution. Overcoming these dilemmas requires more than reforming institutions but rather new thinking about the questions: what is justice? how is it related to the building of peace? Answers to these questions lie in the twin concepts of reconciliation and restorative justice. The symposium explores their potential for overcoming the familiar controversies and offering guidance for peacebuilding. Participation is open to students, scholars, and practitioners interested in transitional justice and peacebuilding. Speakers include John Braithwaite, Phil Clark, Stephen Hopgood, Louise Mallinder, David Tolbert, and Charles Villa-Vicencio. For more information, visit <http://www.iilj.org/newsandevents/RJRP.asp>

A conference on "Free Movement and Discrimination" will take place November 28, 2011 at Glendon College, York University (Toronto, Canada), organized by the European Union Centre of Excellence. Democratic states tend to guarantee free movement within their territory to all citizens. Similarly, the European Union guarantees the right to live and the right to work anywhere within EU territory to EU citizens and members of their families. Such rights reflect the project of equality and undifferentiated individual rights for all who have the status of citizen. But they are not uncontested. Within the EU, several member states have or propose to reintroduce border controls and restrict access for EU citizens who claim social assistance. Some have expelled Roma, which challenges human rights norms against discrimination. Within democratic states, particularly federal ones and others where decentralized jurisdictions are responsible for social welfare provision, it sometimes appears that some citizens are more equal than others. Principles such as benefit portability, prohibition of residence requirements for access to programs or rights, and mutual recognition of qualifications and credentials facilitate the free flow of people within states and reflect the attempt to eliminate internal borders. The purpose of this workshop is to explore the politics of free movement and discrimination in the EU and a range of democratic states. For more information, contact Willem Maas (<maas@yorku.ca>), or visit: <http://ccges.apps01.yorku.ca/wp/news/conference-free-movement-and-discrimination-call-for-papers/>.

The Center for the Study of Citizenship at Wayne State University is hosting its 9th Annual Conference in Citizenship Studies on the theme "Generations: Rethinking Age and Citizenship", to be held on March 29-31, 2012\. The conference will center around the following questions. How are (and were) youth politically socialized? Is there citizenship within youth communities? Other proposals might consider the other end of the age spectrum: the relationship of gerontology and citizenship studies; community engagement by elder citizens who are living longer than ever before; the meaning of "senior citizen." How does the generational divide shape citizenship in diasporic communities? Are there differences in the ways that older and newer generations of immigrants perceive membership in the community or the way that second or third generation immigrant families view their relationship to the public sphere? How does citizenship change over the life course? How important is age as a variable in civic community-building and how does it affect a sense of belonging? Plenary speakers will be Peter Levine, Director of the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning & Engagement, Tufts University, and Lawrence Cohen, Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley. The perspective of the conference is global, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary and proposals on any aspect of citizenship studies are welcome from scholars working in any discipline or interdisciplinary field. Proposals should be submitted online on the Center's website: [www.clas.wayne.edu/citizenship](http://www.clas.wayne.edu/citizenship) no later than October 15, 2011\. Questions should be directed to Marc W. Kruman, <aa1277@wayne.edu>. For more information visit: <http://www.clas.wayne.edu/citizenship/upload/events_citizenship_032012_generations.php>

The 17th Annual World Convention of the Association for the Study of Nationalities (ASN) will focus on "The Wages of Nationhood: Conflicts, Compromises, and Costs", to be held at Columbia University, NY and sponsored by the Harriman Institute between 19-21 April 2012\. For more information, visit [www.nationalities.org](http://www.nationalities.org/).

A conference on "Diverse Spaces: Examining identity, community and citizenship within Canadian public culture" will take place on April 20-21, 2012 at the Frost Centre for Canadian Studies and Indigenous Studies at Trent University in Peterborough, Canada. Identity, belonging and citizenship within the nation state are established, contested and legitimized within sites and institutions of public culture, heritage and representation. In Canada, people from diverse cultural backgrounds seek to engage with cultural, historical and social knowledge in these spaces. While public museums have been primary sites of engagement, some people have sought to create alternative opportunities and institutional spaces to express and represent the complexities of their histories, identities, communities and places in both Canadian and global society. The conference seeks papers that explore the roles that all types of public spaces play in the expression or contestation of different histories, different identities, and different forms of community, national and transnational citizenship. For more information, contact <diversespaces@gmail.com>. The conference is organized by Julia Harrison, Director, and Susan Ashley, SSHRC Postdoctoral Fellow in the Frost Centre for Canadian Studies and Indigenous Studies, Trent University.

The 14th annual Children's Identity and Citizenship in Europe Conference is titled "Creating Citizenship Communities: Local, National and Global", and will take place at the University of York, England from 24-26 May 2012\. The conference brings together 3 significant groups in the field of citizenship education: CitizED (a global network of academics); Children's Identity and Citizenship in Europe (CiCe) (an extensive European network of academics and professionals); and, the project team of the Esmée Fairbairn funded initiative 'Creating Citizenship Communities'. The conference theme of creating citizenship communities is particularly pertinent to citizenship and identities education. It reflects on current concerns for community cohesion from local to global scales and chimes with current initiatives around volunteering and intergenerational solidarity. Leading international academics will provide keynote presentations. For further information on registering for the conference please contact Peter Cunningham at <cice@londonmet.ac.uk>, or visit: <http://www.citized.info/pdf/conferences/YorkFlyer.pdf>

The annual "International Conference on Diversity in Organizations, Communities and Nations" will take place at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada between 11-13 June 2012\. The Diversity Conference has a history of bringing together scholarly, government and practice-based participants with an interest in the issues of diversity and community. The conference examines the concept of diversity as a positive aspect of a global world and globalised society. Diversity is in many ways reflective of our present world order, but there are ways of taking this further without necessary engendering its alternatives: racism, conflict, discrimination and inequity. Diversity as a mode of social existence can be projected in ways that deepen the range of human experience. The conference will seek to explore the full range of what diversity means and explore modes of diversity in real-life situations of living together in community. The conference supports a move away from simple affirmations that 'diversity is good' to a much more nuanced account of the effects and uses of diversity on differently situated communities in the context of our current epoch of globalization. For more information, visit <http://ondiversity.com/conference-2012/>

There will be a conference on "Ethnic Politics and Electoral Democracy" in Zurich from 14-16 June 2012\. The conference is co-organized by Center for the Study of Democracy (UC Irvine) and the NCCR Democracy & Centre for Comparative and International Studies (CIS), University of Zurich. A follow-up conference will be held in New York in October 2012\. For more information, see <http://www.bochsler.eu/ethnicpolitics>.

A conference on "Negative Cosmopolitanisms: Abjection, Power, and Biopolitics" will be held at the University of Alberta 11--13 October 2012 This interdisciplinary conference seeks to explore the array of negative cosmopolitanisms operating today, all those ways in which cosmopolitan subjects are still stigmatized, disempowered, excluded, and denied. The conference will bring researchers together to explore the histories and constitution of cosmopolitanism past and present, with the aim of better understanding the complex experience of power today. The conference keynotes are Timothy Brennan, Pheng Cheah, Sneja Gunew, and Peter Nyers. Proposals shall consist of an abstract of 350-500 words and a one-page CV. Please send applications to Dr. Terri Tomsky by 21 October 2011\. (<tomsky@ualberta.ca>)

##### Journal Special Issues

"Race, Religion, and Late Democracy" is a special issue of THE ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science (September 2011, Volume 637), edited by John L. Jackson, Jr. and David Kyuman Kim. This volume examines the symbiotic connections among race, religion, and democracy and calls for reframing the existing discourse on democracy to reflect the mutually inclusive nature of these forces. The authors argue that race and religion can be sources for humanizing democratic possibilities and explore the relationship between democratic governance and commitments that citizens have to racial solidarities and religious beliefs around the world, including in the United States, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and South America. This volume will appeal to students of politics and religious studies and to a multidisciplinary scholarly audience in anthropology, political sociology, and race and cultural studies.
