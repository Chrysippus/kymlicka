#### 4\. Call for Papers

Creative Education (CE), a peer-reviewed open-access journal, seeks submissions for an upcoming Special Issue on the theme "Global Interconnectedness and Multicultural Education". Education is increasingly becoming international and the rise of mass schooling has implanted the concept that everyone has a right to be educated regardless of cultural and gender differences. Multicultural education permeates all levels of educational practices, policies and organization because it is assumed to be a tool for cultivating positive self-concepts for providing knowledge about histories, cultures, and contributions of diverse groups. Topics to be covered include: learning in an interconnected world; intercultural and multicultural education; study abroad programs; equity pedagogy and equitable educational opportunities; teaching with a multicultural perspective, and others. Submissions should be sent through the submission system at the homepage (below). For inquiries, contact the Editorial Assistant at: <ce@scirp.org>. <http://www.scirp.org/journal/ce/> The Guest Editor for this issue is Dr. Cathy H. Qi (University of New Mexico, USA).

The journal Citizenship Teaching and Learning is inviting submissions for a special issue devoted to exploring citizenship in higher education. The idea that institutions of higher education are institutions of civic instruction is not new. Civic instruction was both an implicit and an explicit outcome of the liberal foundation on which post-secondary education was built. However, in recent years, the influence of neoliberal ideology on post-secondary institutions has obscured such democratic aims as the focus on career preparation and economic prosperity has eclipsed service and engagement as the core goals of a university education. Unsurprisingly, recent research indicates that young people are democratically disengaged from their societies, and that explicit civic instruction can help to combat this disengagement. However, much of that research is undertaken in the context of K-12 education. This special issue aims to highlight the higher education perspective on citizenship education and provide space for discussion of the civic purposes of higher education. Papers on the theme of citizenship and higher education are invited (4,000–6,000 words and following the guidelines of this journal found at: <http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/MediaManager/File/CTL%20NfC.pdf>. The guest-editors will review the submissions and invite up to six authors to revise their papers for inclusion in the journal.

The International Journal of Migration and Border Studies invites submissions for its third issue, which will be published in 2015\. IJMBS aims to bring together a diverse range of scholars and practitioners to advance knowledge and improve practice and methodologies in a broad range of issued related to migration and borders studies. The journal invites submissions from both emerging and established scholars, including graduate students, post- graduates, professors and practitioners from around the globe, with the objective of ensuring that a plurality of experiences and perspectives is represented. Suggested themes for submissions include: innovations in border security and immigration policy; databases and exchanges; coordination with health, education, and social welfare programs; the role of gender, age, social status, ability, race and other factors in curtailing the role of gender, age, social status; and many other theoretical and methodological dimensions related to borders and migration. All papers are refereed through a peer review process and must be submitted online in accordance with the journal's guidelines on preparing and submitting articles. The deadline for submissions is January 31st, 2015\. For other inquiries, contact the Editor-in-Chief, Prof. France Houle (Université de Montréal) at the following email address: <ijmbs.editor@gmail.com> Detailed information is found on the journal website: <http://www.inderscience.com/jhome.php?jcode=ijmbs>
