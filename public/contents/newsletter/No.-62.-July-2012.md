#### 1\. Introduction

The Forum for Philosophy and Public Policy at Queen's University is organizing a multi-year, research project on citizenship, democracy and minority rights in multiethnic states, under the direction of Prof. Will Kymlicka. As part of this project, the Forum distributes a newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which this is the sixty-first issue. We hope that it will be of interest to anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or non-governmental organizations

If you would like to be added to the mailing list for this newsletter, please contact us at <cded@queensu.ca>. Back-issues of the newsletter are posted on the Web on Will Kymlicka's home-page: <http://post.queensu.ca/~kymlicka/ddnewsletter.php>

#### 2\. Upcoming Conferences

A conference was recently held on "The Internationalisation of Dalit and Adivasi Activism", on June 25-26 June 2012 at the University of London, jointly organised by the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London and the Department of Anthropology and Sociology at SOAS.This inter-disciplinary conference aims to advance social scientific understandings of key dimensions of the internationalisation of Dalit and Adivasi activism that has gained momentum in the past two decades. These dimensions include the dilemmas of activism in a changing global context, conflicting or competing activist frames, divergent interventions by international actors, and the influence of emerging international norms on state policy. This conference seeks to discuss aspects of the internationalisation of both types of activism, with three major foci: the relationship between international and national/local activism; the role of international organisations; and connections between Dalit, Adivasi, and other networks in international fora. Further information and conference programme details can be found here: <http://commonwealth.sas.ac.uk/events/event-details.html?id=11630>.

For more information, see <http://www.niod.nl> and <http://www.erfenissenvancollaboratie.nl>. Inquiries may be directed to project coordinator Ismee Tames <mailto:i.tames@niod.knaw.nl>.

A conference on "Minorities, Nations and Cultural Diversity: The Challenge of Non-Territorial Autonomy" will be held on 9-10 November 2012 at Queens University, Belfast, Northern Ireland , co-organized by the European Centre for Minority Issues (Flensburg, Germany), Queens University Belfast, and the University of Glasgow. The aim of the conference is to examine in theory, empirically and through the work of legal practitioners, the challenges, and possible solutions offered by different models of NTA for the effective participation of minorities in public life. Non-Territorial autonomy takes a variety of forms, such as Consociationalism and National Cultural Autonomy, but also forms of de-territorialised self-determination, as in the case of indigenous communities, the juridical autonomy of religious communities, or the practice of some models of multiculturalism. We invite theoretical and comparative papers and case studies on NTA models that build upon theoretical consideration and/or consider empirical case studies addressing the following issues: Can NTA serve the goals of European integration? Can such models be incorporated into the EU minority protection framework? Does NTA help resolve protracted territorial conflicts (such as Bosnia, Kurdistan or Palestine)? What are the limits and/or possibilities of implementing NTA models in liberal democracies? Can NTA models rejuvenate multiculturalism? Can models of NTA enhance the integration of Diasporas? What are the opportunities for Indigenous self-determination within the NTA framework? Can models of NTA help the effective participation of minorities in post-colonial states? And, can NTA models help eliminate the cultural residues of colonialism? The deadline for submitting paper proposals is 21 September. For more information, visit <http://www.conferencepro.eu/nta>.

The Centre for Citizenship and Globalisation (CCG) is holding an international conference in Melbourne, Australia called Reclaiming Multiculturalism: Global Citizenship and Ethical Engagement with Diversity, 15-16 November 2012\. The key themes of the conference are: Differences between Transculturalism, Interculturalism and Multiculturalism; Effects of Anti-multicultural and Anti-cosmopolitan Political and Media Rhetoric; Benefits and Challenges of Intercultural and Interreligious Dialogue and Action; Rights, Religion and Governance; Cosmopolitanism and Ethical Citizenship; Racism, Disempowerment and Recognition; Addressing Gender Inequalities in Multicultural and Multifaith Societies; Multiculturalism, Community Engagement and Countering Violent Extremism; Reconfiguring Self and Other in the Context of Plural Societies.

The Oecumene Project is hosting its Second Symposium on "Deorientalizing citizenship? Experiments in political subjectivity" on 12-13 November 2012 at Goodenough College, London. The Symposium is organised by the European Research Council funded project Oecumene: Citizenship after orientalism based at The Open University. Keynote lectures by Walter Mignolo and Saba Mahmood. The possibility of conceiving practices of citizenship after orientalism points to experiments that uncover, rearticulate and provoke subjugated forms of politics. Through addressing the intersections between orientalism, colonialism and citizenship (panel 1), exploring possibilities of democratic politics for decolonizing citizenship (panel 2) and troubling universal claims to rights (panel 3), we ask what images of citizenship are emerging in relation to the process of deorientalization? It is this experimentation itself, rather than its outcomes, that constitutes 'citizenship after orientalism' as a field of investigation. For more information, visit <http://www.oecumene.eu/events/2nd-symposium>.

The Norwegian Centre for Human Rights is holding its 2012 International Conference in Oslo on "Group Autonomy and Its Critics" on December 7-8 2012\. The main objectives of the conference are to encourage interdisciplinary and international reflection and exchange on core human rights dilemmas pertaining to group autonomy. It also aims to raise public awareness on human rights issues which are key concerns of researchers and programs at the Norwegian Centre for Human Rights. For more information, visit: <http://www.jus.uio.no/smr/om/aktuelt/arrangementer/2012/group-autonomy.html>.

The theme of the next American Society for Political and Legal Philosophy Conference will be on "Immigration, Emigration, and Migration", to be held in New Orleans in conjunction with the meeting of the Association Of American Law Schools on January 4th 2013\. It will be organized by NOMOS editors, Andrew Rehfeld and Jack Knight. Principal papers will be given by: Judith Resnik (Law, Yale); Sarah Song (Political Science, Berkeley); and Tom Christiano (Philosophy, Arizona). Commentators are: James Bohman (Philosophy, Saint Louis University); Jennifer Hochschild (Political Science, Harvard); Adam Cox (Law, NYU); Michael Blake (Philosophy, University of Washington); Arash Abizadeh (Political Science, McGill); and Cristina Rodriguez (Law, NYU). More detailed information will be posted to the ASPLP website as soon as it is available.

"The Shape of Diversity to Come. Global Community, Global Archipelago, or a New Civility?" will take place in January 2013 at Erasmus University Rotterdam. For most political and legal theorists who reflect on diversity and multiculturalism the nation-state is the natural environment in which questions of difference have to be resolved. To be a liberal theorist or a multi-culturalist, in most cases, is to be a liberal or multicultural nationalist. Yet, the nation state, as a formation encompassing a culturally unified people, is now straining under the challenges of globalization and the revolution in communication technology. This conference will consider the dynamic changes that are currently taking place with respect to cultural and religious diversity as a result of the explosion in communication, address the conflicts they give rise to, and discuss the ramifications for law and politics.

Abstracts of no more than 500 words are welcomed for consideration. Proposals should be submitted to the Center's Research Associate, Helen Callow (<helen.callow@wayne.edu>) along with a short biography (50 words) no later than October 15, 2012\.

The Edinburgh Centre for Constitutional Law at the University of Edinburgh will be hosting an International Symposium on 'Nationalism and Globalisation: new settings, new challenges' on 23-24 May 2013\. The Edinburgh Symposium will focus upon the new challenges and opportunities that confront states, sub-state peoples and national minorities in a globalising constitutional environment within which constitutional orders beyond the state become more sophisticated and extend their normative reach. It is hoped that the Symposium will cast new light upon these changing dynamics which will in turn inform political and legal responses to this pressing paradox of our time: resilient vernacular nationalism in an increasingly cosmopolitan age. In short, the key research question posed by the Symposium is: how might we develop conceptual tools with which to adapt the existing normative and empirical literature on the resilience of state nationalism and the accommodation of sub-state nationalism to new settings in a globalising age?

#### 4\. Related Research Projects

"Oecumene: Citizenship after orientalism" is a European Research Council funded project based at The Open University. The purpose of the OECUMENE project is to redefine European citizenship by developing, without the assumptions of orientalism and occidentalism, comparative insights on citizenship understood as political subjectivity in Africa, Asia, Australia or the Americas. For more information about the project go to <http://www.oecumene.eu>.

#### 5\. Fellowships and Courses

"Languages and Authority" is the theme for the 2013/14 Fung Global Fellows Program at Princeton University. This new program will select six scholars from around the world to be in residence at Princeton for an academic year and to engage in research and discussion around a common theme. The Fellows and the accompanying seminar program will focus on how languages interact with political, social, economic, and cultural authority. Languages can be powerful tools for expressing and asserting authority. Yet they also constitute forms of authority in and of themselves (such as in the standardization and uniformity that they impose). Languages as forms of authority are also contested, and language communities have often formed a basis for resisting authority. Possible topics for this cycle of the fellows program include the ways in which languages and language use interact with globalization, empire, decolonization, nation-state formation, nationalism, language policy, language ideology, social stratification, migration, commerce and trade, social and religious movements, and the sociology of knowledge production. Applications are due on November 1, 2012\. We encourage applications from both social scientists and humanists concerning any region of the world or time period. To be eligible, applicants must have received their Ph.D. no earlier than September 1, 2003\. For more information on eligibility requirements and the application process itself, see the Programs website at <http://www.princeton.edu/funggfp/>.

#### 6\. Internet Resources

The Max-Planck-Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity (MPI-MMG) has launched an innovative set of online, interactive tools that allow users to examine country by country, to graphically visualize and to compare the latest and most comprehensive global migration data existing from 1960 to 2000 (with 2010 updates forthcoming). The data visualizers are for: global migration flow data from the United Nations Population Division; global migrant stock data compiled together with the World Bank; and, also based on the latter dataset, migrants by destination that is, the number of people from any particular country found, at any particular time, in all other countries across the world. Where the national data allows, moreover, within each visualizer online users can choose to examine migration data by citizenship or place of birth as well as by gender. To see and use these new graphic tools, please go to the MPI-MMG homepage (<http://www.mmg.mpg.de>) and click on the heading data visualization. Each global migration data visualizer has a set of instructions and an online instruction video. A feedback tab is also supplied for comments, questions and user examples.

The Immanent Frame blog had a recent discussion of "Multiculturalism in Europe". After the rise of multicultural policies in the 1980s and 1990s, the winds have shifted in Europe. We ask a panel of respondents to address questions of increasing social tensions in Europe and the popularity of conservative positions on immigration and religious freedom, with special attention paid to those cases involving Islam. Our respondents are Sindre Bangstad, Keith Banting and Will Kymlicka, Rajeev Bhargava, Jocelyne Cesari, Grace Davie, Ruby Gropas, and Elizabeth H. Prodromou. Visit: <http://tif.li/M7zTjG>.

Resetdoc has recently posted a roundtable on "The Background of Xenophobia" focusing on the cultural and political roots of nationalist and anti-immigrant rhetoric as they affect public life from Europe to the USA. Speakers include Giancarlo Bosetti, Ian Buruma, Seyla Benhabib, Benjamin Barber and Jytte Klausen. See <http://www.resetdoc.org/story/00000022027>
