# Democracy and Diversity Newsletter

As part of a multi-year project on citizenship, democracy and ethnocultural diversity, from 1995 to 2014, I edited and distributed an electronic newsletter updating recent developments in the field, of which seventy issues were produced. The newsletter contained information about upcoming conferences, recent publications, journals, internet resources, and related research programs, intended for anyone working in the field, whether in academia, public service, or various non-governmental organizations.
